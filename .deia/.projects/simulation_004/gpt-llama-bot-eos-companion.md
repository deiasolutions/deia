# GPT Llama Bot Development LLH

## Purpose

This LLH manages the development and deployment of a web GUI for GPT Llama Bot that maintains full CLI-like file system capabilities within the DEIA project ecosystem. The bot provides an interface between users and local LLM (Ollama) while respecting DEIA project boundaries and security constraints.

## Mission Statement

Create a secure, user-friendly web interface that enables:
- Full file system operations within DEIA project boundaries
- Real-time chat with local LLM (Ollama)
- File modification capabilities with confirmation workflows
- Integration with DEIA project structure and specifications

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Development Management
- Coordinate development phases (Basic Chat → File Operations → File Modifications → Polish)
- Manage technology stack decisions (FastAPI + HTML/CSS/JS recommended)
- Oversee security implementation and access controls

### 2. Security Enforcement
- Enforce localhost-only access by default
- Implement file operation confirmations
- Maintain audit logs of all file modifications
- Ensure project directory boundary restrictions

### 3. Integration Coordination
- Integrate with DEIA project structure
- Load specification documents automatically
- Provide Git integration for change tracking
- Maintain conversation history and context

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **FastAPI**: Primary backend framework
- **Ollama**: Local LLM integration
- **WebSocket**: Real-time streaming support

### Frontend Stack
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Core frontend (Phase 1)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework
- **Alpine.js**: Interactivity layer

### Security Layer
- Project directory restriction
- File modification confirmation dialogs
- Read-only mode toggle capability
- Session management

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Chat (30 min target)
- FastAPI server setup
- Ollama integration
- Simple chat UI with streaming
- Basic WebSocket implementation

### Phase 2: File Operations (1 hour target)
- File reading from project directory
- Code syntax highlighting
- File context display in chat
- Project structure browser

### Phase 3: File Modifications (2 hours target)
- File writing with confirmation
- Diff viewer before changes
- Undo functionality
- Change logging

### Phase 4: Polish (ongoing)
- Enhanced UI/UX
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Project-aware context
- Conversation save/load

## Pheromone Signals

### Development Milestone
```json
{
  "type": "development_milestone",
  "phase": "basic_chat|file_ops|file_mods|polish",
  "status": "completed|in_progress|blocked",
  "details": "Phase completion details"
}
```

### Deployment Ready
```json
{
  "type": "deployment_ready",
  "version": "x.y.z",
  "features": ["chat", "file_ops", "file_mods"],
  "security_status": "validated"
}
```

### Security Alert
```json
{
  "type": "security_alert",
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "issue": "Description of security concern",
  "action_required": "immediate|planned|monitor"
}
```

## Coordination Protocols

### Daily Standup
- Review development progress
- Identify blockers and dependencies
- Plan next day's priorities
- Security status check

### File Operation Workflow
1. User requests file modification
2. LLH validates request against project boundaries
3. Show diff preview to user
4. Require explicit confirmation
5. Log operation to RSE
6. Apply changes
7. Emit completion pheromone

### Security Monitoring
- Continuous monitoring of file access patterns
- Regular security boundary validation
- Audit log review
- Incident response procedures

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Basic chat interface operational
- [ ] File reading capabilities implemented
- [ ] File modification with confirmation workflow
- [ ] Project structure integration
- [ ] Real-time streaming responses

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Project directory boundary enforcement
- [ ] File modification confirmation system
- [ ] Audit logging implementation
- [ ] Localhost-only access by default
- [ ] Session management

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Sub-second response times for file operations
- [ ] Smooth streaming chat experience
- [ ] Efficient memory usage
- [ ] Reliable WebSocket connections

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Ollama Integration Issues**: Fallback to alternative LLM endpoints
- **WebSocket Stability**: Implement reconnection logic
- **File System Permissions**: Comprehensive error handling

### Security Risks
- **Directory Traversal**: Strict path validation
- **Unauthorized Access**: Multi-layer authentication
- **Data Leakage**: Encrypted session management

## Integration Points

### DEIA Project Integration
- Load DEIA specification documents
- Respect project file structure
- Integrate with existing tools and workflows
- Maintain compatibility with DEIA principles

### External Dependencies
- Ollama local LLM service
- Git repository integration
- File system access controls
- Web browser compatibility

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Development Metrics
- Phase completion rates
- Code quality metrics
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks

### Operational Metrics
- User session duration
- File operation frequency
- Error rates and types
- Security incident counts

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced code editor integration
- Multi-user collaboration
- Plugin architecture
- Mobile responsiveness

### Scalability Considerations
- Multi-project support
- Distributed deployment
- Load balancing
- Caching strategies
