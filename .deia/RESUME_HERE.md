# Resume Point for BOT-00003

**Date:** 2025-10-12 01:48:00
**Bot:** BOT-00003 (Drone-Integration)
**Instance:** 6ae42afc
**Status:** Testing in progress, paused for reboot

---

## Current Task: BACKLOG-006 - Implement `deia /` command

**Progress:** Step 4/7 (Testing Basic Functionality)

### What Was Done:
1. ✓ Reviewed existing implementation (slash_command.py and CLI integration exist)
2. ✓ Confirmed code is complete and integrated
3. ⏸ Started testing - discovered Git Bash path conversion issue

### Issue Found:
Git Bash on Windows converts `/` to `C:/Program Files/Git/` before Python sees it, preventing the command from working via `deia / --help` syntax.

**Command registered correctly:** `deia --help` shows `/` command exists
**Implementation complete:** slash_command.py has full SlashCommandHandler class
**CLI integration done:** Line 1128 of cli.py shows `@main.command(name='/')`

### Next Steps After Reboot:

1. **Test via Python directly** (bypass shell conversion):
   ```python
   python -c "from deia.cli import main; import sys; sys.argv = ['deia', '/', '--help']; main()"
   ```

2. **Alternative testing approaches:**
   - Test via PowerShell (may not have same path conversion)
   - Test the SlashCommandHandler class directly via Python
   - Document the Git Bash limitation

3. **Complete remaining steps:**
   - Step 5: Test broadcast functionality
   - Step 6: File completion report (`.deia/reports/BOT-00003-slash-command-complete.md`)
   - Step 7: Mark task complete in coordinator
   - Move to queued tasks (BACKLOG-009, BACKLOG-010)

### Files Modified This Session:
- `.deia/instructions/BOT-00003-instructions.md` (claimed by 6ae42afc)

**To resume:** Re-read this file, claim/verify BOT-00003 identity, continue from Step 4 testing.
