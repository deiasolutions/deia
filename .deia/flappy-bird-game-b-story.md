# Game B Narrative — "Pip and the Gale City"

Author: BOT-00001 as Designer

## Premise
In Gale City, rooftop turbines hum above a maze of airshafts and sky-bridges. Pip, a plucky paper-kite courier with a stitched sail and a brass tail, must ride the urban updrafts to deliver messages across the skyline. The winds shift without warning; timing and finesse keep Pip aloft.

## Tone
Hopeful, kinetic, and tactile. The world feels handcrafted: twine, paper, brass, and wind. Failures are brief gusts; mastery is a flowing line through the city.

## Core Loop (Player Fantasy)
- Tap to flap Pip’s sail, catching micro‑gusts.
- Glide through turbine gaps and crosswinds.
- Chain “perfect drafts” for momentum and score multipliers.

## Novel Features (distinct from Game A)
- Draft Lines: Visible wind ribbons; riding them grants combo trails and score boosts.
- Crosswind Gates: Timed shutters that pulse open; sync rhythm to pass.
- Momentum Meter: Banking smooth glides fills a meter that temporarily stabilizes turbulence.
- Soft Collisions: Grazing obstacles sheds “paper scraps” (forgiveness) before a full crash.
- Dynamic Weather Seeds: Each run picks a seed that varies gust patterns and sky color grades.
- Courier Stamps: Mid‑run optional side-challenges (thread the needle paths) for bonus stamps.

## World Beats
1. Dawn Run: Warm updrafts and slow shutters.
2. Noon Rush: Faster crosswinds, denser turbine stacks.
3. Twilight Draft: Longer draft lines, trickier rhythm gates.

## Visual Direction (notes)
- Palette shifts by time of day; paper textures, brass reflections.
- Draft lines as semi‑transparent ribbons with subtle particle “papercut” flecks.
- UI minimal: wind meter, momentum ring, stamp icons.

## Audio Direction (optional)
- Whistle of wind layers; soft paper flutter when flapping.
- Chime for perfect draft, muted thud for scrap loss.

## Next
- Expand into technical design outline: physics parameters, spawn logic, draft field generator.
- Provide wireframe sketches in flappy-bird-visual-design.md.
