## Stance Graph

### Issue: immigration-border-security

**Position:** Supports border security but emphasizes federal responsibility and humane treatment. Opposes state overreach (like Abbott's tactics). Supports comprehensive federal reform. Less aggressive rhetoric than predecessor (Ducey) or neighboring GOP governors.

**Confidence:** medium-high

**Evidence:**
- **[Statement, Jan 2023]** - "Border security is a federal responsibility. Arizona will do our part, but we need federal action" - AZ Gov press release
- **[Criticized Abbott tactics, Aug 2024]** - "Sending buses of migrants is a political stunt that doesn't solve problems" - Arizona Republic
- **[Deployed National Guard, 2023]** - Continued limited Guard deployment at border (inherited from Ducey) - AZ Nat'l Guard
- **[Called for comprehensive reform, Sept 2024]** - "We need border security AND immigration reform. It's not either/or" - Phoenix press conference

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific policy preferences on border technology, barriers, asylum less detailed. Balancing act between progressive base (wants humane treatment) and swing voters (want security). Unclear how much she'd spend on state-level enforcement if Legislature offered funding.

### Issue: water-climate

**Position:** Prioritizes water conservation and Colorado River negotiations. Frames climate as existential threat to Arizona (heat, drought). Supports renewable energy transition. Pragmatic on growth vs. sustainability.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Colorado River negotiations, 2023]** - Worked with CA, NV on water conservation deal - Bureau of Reclamation
- **[Executive order on water, March 2023]** - Restricted new groundwater-dependent development in Phoenix area - AZ Gov EO
- **[Climate action plan, June 2024]** - Set renewable energy goals, heat mitigation strategies - AZ Gov press release
- **[Statement on Lake Mead, 2024]** - "Water is Arizona's most precious resource. Conservation is not optional" - Interview, Arizona Republic

**Uncertainty Notes:** Growth vs. conservation trade-offs not fully resolved; Phoenix area development vs. water limits an ongoing tension. Specific renewable energy timeline goals sometimes vague.

### Issue: abortion-state-policy

**Position:** Strong pro-choice. Opposed near-total ban (1864 law revival), supported repeal. Frames as healthcare and freedom issue. Major campaign theme in 2022.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Vetoed abortion restrictions, 2023-2024]** - Multiple bills from GOP Legislature - AZ Legislature records
- **[Statement on 1864 law, April 2024]** - "This near-total ban is unconscionable. I will fight to repeal it" - Press conference
- **[Signed repeal, May 2024]** - When Legislature passed repeal of 1864 law - Arizona Capitol Times
- **[Campaign 2022]** - Abortion rights central to campaign; attacked opponent's record - Campaign ads, Arizona Republic

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific gestational limits or restrictions not always detailed; emphasis on access and choice broadly. Post-repeal landscape still developing.

### Issue: education-school-choice

**Position:** Opposes universal voucher expansion. Supports public education funding increases. Criticized "ESA" (Education Scholarship Accounts) program as budget-buster that helps wealthy.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Vetoed voucher expansion bills, 2023]** - Multiple ESA expansion attempts - AZ Legislature records
- **[Budget fight, 2024]** - Demanded public school funding increases vs. GOP voucher expansion - Arizona Capitol Times
- **[Statement, Sept 2024]** - "Universal vouchers are draining money from public schools that 90% of kids attend" - Interview
- **[Teacher pay advocacy]** - Pushed for teacher raises in budget negotiations - AZ Gov press releases

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific public school funding increases sought not always specified in detail. Position on limited/targeted school choice (special needs, low-income) vs. universal not fully explicit.

## Constraints & Budgets

### Political Capital

**Current:** medium (narrow win, vulnerable, but survived first legislative session)

**Burn Rate:** medium (spends on vetoes, budget fights)

**Constraints:**
- Must win over swing voters for 2026 (cannot rely on base alone)
- Republican Legislature limits policy wins
- 2022 election denialism still fraught; must defend democratic process

### Attention Budget

**Current:** constrained

**Major Commitments:**
- Legislative sessions (annual, contentious with GOP Legislature)
- Water negotiations (ongoing crisis)
- Border coordination (federal-led, but state role)
- Heat emergencies (summers increasingly deadly)
- 2026 re-election campaign (likely starts 2025)
- Veto reviews (numerous GOP bills)

### Procedural Constraints

**Calendar:**
- Legislature meets annually; constant budget and policy fights

**Rules:**
- Republican supermajority possible in future (currently close)
- Governor veto can be overridden with 2/3 vote
- Ballot initiatives bypass governor (direct democracy frequent in AZ)

**Party Pressure:**
- Base wants aggressive progressive positioning
- Swing voters want pragmatic moderation
- National Democrats want Arizona competitiveness preserved (swing state)

---

## Behavioral Tendencies

### Rhetoric Style

**Patterns:**
- Emphasizes pragmatism and problem-solving over ideology
- Less bombastic than national Democrats; Arizona-specific focus
- Frames issues as "common sense" vs. "extremism"
- Uses local examples (water, heat, schools) more than national culture war
- Positioning as protector of democracy (post-2020 election denialism)

**Media strategy:**
- Arizona media primary (Arizona Republic, local TV)
- Less national media than some governors (not presidential aspirant)
- Social media present but not dominant
- Emphasizes governor work over political theater

### Coalition Building

**Historical patterns:**
- Won 2022 with coalition of Democrats, independents, moderate Republicans
- Must maintain that coalition for 2026
- Works with moderate GOP legislators when possible (rare)
- Builds coalitions with other Democratic governors (water, reproductive rights)
- Uses veto strategically (signals priorities without needing Legislature)

### Procedural Moves

**Preferred tactics:**
- Vetoes of GOP legislation (primary tool)
- Executive orders where possible (limited by Legislature)
- Budget negotiations (trade-offs for priorities)
- Interstate compacts (water, especially)
- Federal coordination (DHS, Interior on border and water)

**Avoids:**
- High-profile national culture war fights (stays AZ-focused)
- Alienating moderate Republicans completely (needs some for budget)
- Overreaching with executive orders (legal vulnerability)

### Risk Tolerance

**Level:** medium-low

**Evidence:**
- Cautious on border (avoids Abbott-style escalation)
- Pragmatic on budget (willing to compromise to get some wins)
- But: Firm on abortion (vetoed all restrictions despite political risk)
- Willing to veto hundreds of bills (assertive but within norms)

## Simulation Hooks

### Pheromone Emissions (Typical)

- `veto_issued` - When vetoing GOP legislation (frequent during session)
- `budget_negotiation_update` - When working with Legislature on budget (annual)
- `water_conservation_order` - When addressing drought/water crisis (sporadic)
- `heat_emergency_declared` - When activating heat response (summers)
- `border_coordination_request` - When seeking federal action on border (sporadic)
- `election_integrity_defense` - When defending democratic process (sporadic, post-2020)

### Response Patterns

- When `gop_partisan_bill` detected → Assess for veto; likely veto if far-right
- When `border_crisis_event` detected → Call for federal action, avoid state overreach
- When `water_crisis_event` detected → Activate conservation measures, negotiate with feds/other states
- When `heat_emergency` detected → Activate cooling centers, emergency response

### Veto Points

- **State legislation:** Can veto, but GOP can override with 2/3 (difficult but possible)
- **Budget line items:** Can veto specific appropriations
- **Agency control:** Can direct state agencies within budget
- **Interstate negotiations:** Can influence multi-state compacts (water)

### Amplification Factors

- **Swing state:** Arizona national focus; governor actions watched closely
- **Border state:** Geographic position gives border voice
- **Water leader:** Colorado River crisis gives national relevance
- **2026 race:** Likely competitive; national Dem money and attention

## Metadata

**Data Sources:**
- Arizona Governor's Office (press releases, executive orders)
- Arizona Republic (primary state political coverage)
- Arizona Capitol Times (legislative coverage)
- Arizona Legislature records (bills, votes, budget)
- National media (occasional coverage of swing state governor)

**Last Evidence Date:** October 2024

**Confidence Score:** medium-high
- High confidence on abortion (clear record, major campaign theme)
- High confidence on water (signature issue, active negotiations)
- Medium-high confidence on border (less aggressive than GOP, but specific policies less detailed)
- High confidence on education (clear opposition to vouchers)

- Check Colorado River negotiations (ongoing)
- Watch for Abbott/Hobbs interactions (border state tensions)
