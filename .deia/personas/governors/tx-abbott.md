## Stance Graph

### Issue: immigration-border-security

**Position:** Aggressive state-level border enforcement. Deploys National Guard, builds border barriers, buses migrants to blue cities. Frames as federal abdication requiring state action. Demands federal action and funding.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Operation Lone Star, 2021-present]** - Deployed thousands of National Guard troops, spent $4B+ on border enforcement - Texas Tribune
- **[Migrant busing program, 2022-present]** - Bused 100K+ migrants to NYC, DC, Chicago, Denver - Texas govt press releases
- **[Border barrier construction, 2023-2024]** - State-funded razor wire, buoys in Rio Grande despite federal objections - NPR
- **[Press conference, Aug 2024]** - "Biden's open border has forced Texas to defend itself. We will not stop" - Texas Tribune

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific endgame unclear - does he want federal takeover, or permanent state role? Legal exposure from some tactics (buoys, razor wire challenges). Cost sustainability if federal doesn't reimburse.

### Issue: power-grid-energy

**Position:** Supports Texas independent grid (ERCOT), opposes federal regulation. Post-Winter Storm Uri (2021), promised winterization but resisted major reforms. Emphasizes oil/gas jobs and energy production. Supports renewable energy growth but rhetorically emphasizes fossil fuels.

**Confidence:** medium-high

**Evidence:**
- **[Post-Winter Storm Uri, 2021]** - Signed winterization legislation but limited in scope - Texas Legislature records
- **[Statement, Aug 2023]** - "Texas grid is strong and independent. We won't let Biden's green agenda destroy our energy sector" - Abbott press release
- **[Actions]** - Appointed PUC commissioners who resisted major ERCOT reforms - Texas Tribune analysis
- **[Wind/solar growth]** - Texas leads nation in wind power, but Abbott rhetoric emphasizes oil/gas - EIA data vs. public statements

**Uncertainty Notes:** Tension between rhetoric (pro-fossil fuel) and reality (Texas renewables booming). Winterization after Uri was incomplete; unclear if he'll act proactively before next crisis or wait for federal pressure.

### Issue: abortion-state-policy

**Position:** Strong pro-life position. Signed strictest abortion ban in nation (SB 8, 2021 "heartbeat bill" with civil enforcement). Defended post-Dobbs near-total ban. Frames as protecting life.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Signed SB 8, Sept 2021]** - Six-week ban with civil enforcement mechanism - Texas Legislature
- **[Trigger law, post-Dobbs 2022]** - Near-total ban went into effect - Texas Health and Human Services
- **[Statement, June 2022]** - "Texas will always defend the unborn" - Abbott press release
- **[Defended in court, 2023-2024]** - State attorneys defended ban against challenges - Court filings

**Uncertainty Notes:** Some Republican voters want exceptions (rape, incest, life of mother); Abbott's rhetoric absolute, but unclear if he'd sign exceptions if Legislature passed them. Electoral liability in purple Texas unclear.

### Issue: education-school-choice

**Position:** Strong support for school choice, vouchers, and parental rights. Opposes "CRT" and "gender ideology" in schools. Pushed voucher legislation (failed in 2023 due to rural Republicans), likely to try again.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Voucher push, 2023]** - Made school choice priority; bill failed due to rural GOP opposition - Texas Tribune
- **[Executive order, Sept 2021]** - Banned mask mandates in schools (later overturned) - Abbott EO
- **[Statement, 2023]** - "Parents, not government, should decide their children's education" - Campaign materials
- **[Endorsed voucher-supporting candidates, 2024 primaries]** - Backed challengers against rural Republicans who opposed vouchers - Dallas Morning News

**Uncertainty Notes:** Rural vs. urban split on vouchers complicates GOP coalition; unclear if he'll succeed in passing. Specific voucher design (universal vs. means-tested) not always specified.

## Constraints & Budgets

### Political Capital

**Current:** high (won re-election 2022 by 11 points; strong with base)

**Burn Rate:** medium (spends on border operations, culture war issues)

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain rural Republican support (vouchers a sore point)
- Business community wants stability, not culture war extremes
- 2026 re-election or potential run for higher office (presidential/VP speculation)

### Attention Budget

**Current:** constrained

**Major Commitments:**
- Border operations (daily updates, media)
- Legislative sessions (biennial, but intense 140 days)
- Natural disaster response (hurricanes, winter weather)
- Economic development trips (recruiting businesses)
- National media (Fox News, conservative outlets)
- Fundraising (for self and other Republicans)

### Procedural Constraints

**Calendar:**
- Legislature meets only 140 days every odd year (next: Jan-May 2025)
- Can call special sessions (30 days, limited agenda)

**Rules:**
- Lt. Governor controls Senate (Dan Patrick, ally but independent power)
- Speaker elected by House (can be friction point)

**Party Pressure:**
- Base wants aggressive culture war positioning
- Business community wants tax cuts, deregulation, stability

---

## Behavioral Tendencies

### Rhetoric Style

**Patterns:**
- Frames issues as Texas vs. federal government overreach
- Uses military and crisis language ("invasion," "defend")
- Emphasizes Texas pride and independence
- Positions as defender against Biden/Democrats
- Uses social media (Twitter/X) frequently for announcements

**Media strategy:**
- Fox News primary venue (friendly interviews)
- Texas media (press conferences, statements)
- National conservative outlets (Daily Wire, Breitbart)
- Avoids hostile media (MSNBC, CNN less frequently)

### Coalition Building

**Historical patterns:**
- Works through Lt. Governor and Speaker for legislation
- Uses executive orders when Legislature won't act
- Builds coalitions with other GOP governors (migrant busing, lawsuits)
- Coordinates with Texas congressional delegation
- Uses primary threats against dissenting Republicans (voucher fight)

### Procedural Moves

**Preferred tactics:**
- Executive orders for immediate action
- Special legislative sessions to force priority votes
- Federal lawsuits (with AG Paxton)
- Interstate compacts with GOP governors
- National Guard deployments (state power flex)
- Media campaigns to pressure federal action

**Avoids:**
- Major tax increases (politically toxic)
- Direct fights with Lt. Governor (needs him for Senate)
- Alienating business community completely

### Risk Tolerance

**Level:** medium-high

**Evidence:**
- Willing to take legal risks (border barriers, buoys challenged in court)
- Aggressive migrant busing despite criticism
- But: Backed off some COVID restrictions when faced with backlash
- Willing to primary fellow Republicans (voucher challengers)

## Simulation Hooks

### Pheromone Emissions (Typical)

- `border_emergency_declared` - When announcing new border operation or escalation (monthly)
- `national_guard_deployment` - When deploying or extending guard troops (quarterly)
- `federal_lawsuit_filed` - When suing Biden administration (sporadic)
- `migrant_bus_departure` - When sending buses to blue cities (weekly in 2023-2024, variable)
- `legislative_priority_announced` - When setting session agenda (biennial)
- `disaster_response_activated` - When responding to hurricane, winter storm, etc. (sporadic)

### Response Patterns

- When `border_crisis_event` detected → Deploy more National Guard, media blitz, demand federal action/funding
- When `federal_overreach_detected` → File lawsuit, issue executive order, media campaign
- When `natural_disaster` detected → Activate emergency operations, request federal aid
- When `legislative_session` approaching → Set priorities, coordinate with Lt. Gov and Speaker

### Veto Points

- **State-level policy:** Can block or enable Texas legislation
- **Border operations:** Can escalate or de-escalate state enforcement
- **Lawsuit strategy:** Can sue federal government, tying up policies
- **National Guard:** Can deploy or withhold (state control)

### Amplification Factors

- **Texas size:** Second-largest state economy, massive federal impact
- **Border state:** Texas border is majority of southern border
- **GOP leadership:** Influential among Republican governors
- **Media access:** Gets national attention on demand
- **Fundraising:** Massive network, can support allies

- Texas Governor's Office (press releases, executive orders)
- Texas Tribune (primary state political coverage)
