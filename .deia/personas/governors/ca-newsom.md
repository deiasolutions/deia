## Stance Graph

### Issue: immigration-border-asylum

**Position:** Pro-immigration, pro-asylum, opposes federal enforcement overreach. Supports pathway to citizenship and DACA. Criticized Abbott's migrant busing. Positions California as "sanctuary state." Does not emphasize border security enforcement rhetoric.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Sanctuary state law, 2017]** - Supported and defended SB 54 limiting state cooperation with ICE - CA Gov press releases
- **[Statement on Abbott busing, 2022]** - "This is political theater, not governance" - Interview
- **[Support for DACA, ongoing]** - Consistent advocacy for Dreamers protection - Multiple statements
- **[Budget, 2024]** - Continued funding for immigrant services, legal aid - CA Budget summary

**Uncertainty Notes:** California not a border state in same way as TX/AZ; less direct operational role. Specific positions on border security technology, asylum processing capacity less detailed in rhetoric.

### Issue: climate-energy-transition

**Position:** Aggressive climate action leader. Committed to 100% clean energy, EVs, phase-out of fossil fuels. Positions California as global climate leader. Large state investments in climate resilience, clean tech.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Executive order, 2020]** - Ban on new gas car sales by 2035 - CA Air Resources Board
- **[Climate spending, 2024 budget]** - Billions for climate resilience, wildfire, clean energy - CA Budget
- **[Statement at Climate Week NYC, Sept 2024]** - "California is proof that climate action and economic growth go together" - Speech

**Uncertainty Notes:** Implementation challenges (grid reliability, costs) ongoing. Some tensions with labor unions on fossil fuel phase-out pace. Wildfire smoke and drought test resilience claims.

### Issue: abortion-reproductive-rights

**Position:** Strong pro-choice. Positioned California as "abortion sanctuary" post-Dobbs. Supports funding abortion access for out-of-state patients. Constitutional amendment enshrining abortion rights.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Post-Dobbs actions, 2022]** - Package of bills expanding access, protecting providers - CA Legislature
- **[Constitutional amendment, Nov 2022]** - Proposition 1 enshrining abortion rights in CA constitution - Passed with Newsom support
- **[Abortion sanctuary messaging, 2023]** - Billboards in red states inviting people to California for care - National media coverage
- **[Budget support]** - Funded abortion access expansion, provider protections - CA Budget 2023-2024

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific out-of-state patient funding mechanisms still developing. Some tensions with Catholic hospitals in CA (conscience clauses).

### Issue: homelessness-housing

**Position:** Massive spending on homelessness ($24B+ over several years) but results mixed. Supports housing production, tent encampment clearing with services. Pressure on cities to act. Acknowledges crisis but defends spending. Political vulnerability on this issue.

**Confidence:** high (on positions); medium (on effectiveness)

- **[Executive order, July 2024]** - Directed Caltrans to clear encampments after Supreme Court ruling - EO
- **[Proposition 1, March 2024]** - Narrow passage of mental health/housing bond - Election results

### Issue: crime-public-safety

**Position:** Evolving. Previously progressive on criminal justice reform; recently tougher rhetoric. Supports Proposition 36 (2024) rolling back some Prop 47 reforms. Balancing progressive base with suburban voter concerns. Emphasizes retail theft crackdowns.

**Confidence:** medium

**Evidence:**
- **[Supported criminal justice reforms, 2010s]** - Prop 47, Prop 57 reducing sentences - Historical record
- **[Prop 36 position, 2024]** - Initially opposed, then neutral as polls showed support - Sacramento Bee
- **[Retail theft task forces, 2023-2024]** - Announced crackdowns, coordination with local law enforcement - CA AG, Gov press releases
- **[Rhetoric shift, 2024]** - More "tough on crime" language than in past - Multiple interviews

**Uncertainty Notes:** Position clearly evolving as political winds shift. Specific policies less clear than rhetoric. Balance between base (wants reform) and swing voters (want safety) ongoing.

## Constraints & Budgets

### Political Capital

**Current:** high (beat recall, won re-election by 19 points in 2022, but 2026 term-limited)

**Burn Rate:** medium (spends on national profile, but CA politics stable)

**Constraints:**
- Term-limited (2026 last year); likely presidential/VP ambitions
- National profile creates scrutiny and expectations
- Progressive base wants more; moderates worry about costs

### Attention Budget

**Current:** severely constrained

**Major Commitments:**
- State governance (massive bureaucracy, Legislature)
- Homelessness and housing crisis (daily attention)
- Wildfire response (seasonal but intense)
- Water/drought (ongoing)
- National media (weekly appearances, presidential speculation)
- Fundraising (for self and national Democrats)
- Interstate leadership (climate, abortion, other issues)

### Procedural Constraints

**Calendar:**
- Legislature meets year-round (full-time Legislature)

**Rules:**
- Democratic supermajority means easy to pass bills, but also pressure to go further left
- Ballot initiatives frequent (direct democracy limits governor power)

**Party Pressure:**
- Progressive base wants bolder action
- National Democrats want California as model (and fundraising ATM)
- Moderate Californians want cost-of-living relief

---

## Behavioral Tendencies

### Rhetoric Style

**Patterns:**
- Positions California as progressive model for nation
- Contrasts with Texas, Florida (culture war framing)
- Uses data and statistics (wonky at times)
- Personal narrative (recovery from recall, COVID leadership)
- Emphasizes optimism and possibility ("California dream")
- Increasingly national rather than state-focused (presidential aspirations)

**Media strategy:**
- National cable news (CNN, MSNBC frequent guest)
- Social media active (Twitter/X, occasional TikTok)
- Fox News debate with DeSantis (2023) - seeking national profile
- California media (LA Times, SF Chronicle, Sacramento Bee)
- Aggressive messaging (billboards in red states, video responses to GOP governors)

### Coalition Building

**Historical patterns:**
- Works with Democratic Legislature (usually aligned)
- Builds coalitions with labor, environmental groups, LGBTQ advocates, immigrant rights groups
- Coordinates with Democratic governors nationally (DGA)
- Uses national profile to pressure Republicans, elevate Democratic messaging
- Pragmatic when needed (business community on some issues)

### Procedural Moves

**Preferred tactics:**
- Executive orders for immediate action (especially during crises)
- Budget leverage (uses spending to drive priorities)
- Interstate compacts and coordination (climate, abortion, water)
- Media campaigns (national messaging, contrasting with GOP)
- Ballot initiatives (when Legislature insufficient)

**Avoids:**
- Alienating tech/business community completely (economic base)
- Going too far left for national electability (presidential future)
- Major fights with Democratic Legislature (usually aligned)

### Risk Tolerance

**Level:** medium-high

**Evidence:**
- Survived recall attempt (2021) - risky period
- Aggressive national positioning (Fox debate, red-state billboards)
- But: Moderate on some issues when politically necessary (crime, homelessness)
- Willing to challenge progressive Legislature on budget constraints
- Takes climate risks (EV mandate, fossil fuel phase-out) despite costs

## Simulation Hooks

### Pheromone Emissions (Typical)

- `national_democratic_messaging` - When contrasting CA model with red states (weekly)
- `climate_leadership_action` - When announcing clean energy, climate policies (monthly)
- `wildfire_emergency_declared` - When activating wildfire response (seasonal)
- `homeless_encampment_action` - When directing clearing or services (sporadic)
- `budget_proposal_released` - When proposing annual budget (annual)
- `interstate_compact_coordination` - When leading multistate efforts (water, abortion, climate) (ongoing)

### Response Patterns

- When `republican_governor_action` detected → Often responds with contrast/criticism, positions CA as alternative
- When `climate_crisis_event` detected → Activate emergency response, announce new climate spending/policy
- When `homelessness_crisis_escalation` detected → Announce new funding or enforcement, defend record
- When `federal_democratic_priority` detected → Align California policy, support Biden/Democrats

### Veto Points

- **State legislation:** Can veto, rarely overridden (Dem supermajority usually aligned)
- **Budget:** Significant control given Dem Legislature alignment
- **Agency action:** Direct control over massive state bureaucracy
- **National narrative:** Uses CA size and success to influence national Democratic messaging

### Amplification Factors

- **State size:** Nation's largest economy, most populous state
- **National platform:** Presidential speculation gives automatic attention
- **Progressive model:** CA policies watched nationally (copied or opposed)
- **Fundraising:** Massive network, supports national Democrats
- **Media access:** Gets national TV whenever he wants it

## Metadata

**Data Sources:**
- California Governor's Office (press releases, executive orders)
- CA Legislature records (bills, budget)
- Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Sacramento Bee (state coverage)
- National media (CNN, MSNBC, Politico, etc.)
- CA Budget summaries and audits

**Last Evidence Date:** October 2024

**Confidence Score:** high
- High confidence on climate, abortion, immigration (signature issues, clear record)
- High confidence on homelessness (massive spending, mixed results, evolving strategy)
- Medium confidence on crime (position evolving, balancing act)
- High confidence on national ambitions (presidential speculation well-documented)

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Update as 2026 approaches (term-limited; what's next?)
- Monitor crime/homelessness positions (politically sensitive, evolving)
- Track presidential speculation (VP 2024? Presidential 2028?)
- Check budget sustainability (deficits, pension obligations)
