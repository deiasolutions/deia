## Stance Graph

### Issue: immigration-border-security

**Position:** Strong opposition to enforcement-focused border bills. Supports pathway to citizenship, DACA protection, humane asylum processing. Opposes border wall funding and increased detention. Frames as human rights and racial justice issue.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Floor speech, May 2023]** - "H.R. 2 is a white supremacist vision of immigration policy. It's cruel, it's inhumane, it's un-American" - C-SPAN
- **[Voted NO on H.R. 2]** - Led progressive opposition - Congress.gov
- **[Twitter, July 2024]** - "We need comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship, not militarization of the border" - @AOC
- **[Committee hearing, March 2024]** - Questioned DHS Secretary on detention conditions, family separations - Oversight Committee transcript

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific policy details on visa reform, guest worker programs less emphasized; primary focus on legalization and humane treatment. Position on border technology vs. physical barriers not always explicit.

### Issue: fiscal-climate-green-new-deal

**Position:** Strong advocate for Green New Deal framework: massive federal investment in clean energy, jobs guarantee, climate justice. Supports wealth taxes and progressive taxation to fund. Frames climate as existential crisis requiring mobilization-scale response.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Green New Deal Resolution, Feb 2019]** - Lead sponsor with Sen. Markey - Congress.gov
- **[Floor speech, Sept 2024]** - "Climate change is not a future threat, it's killing people now. We need Green New Deal-scale investment" - C-SPAN

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific funding mechanisms sometimes vary in emphasis (wealth tax vs. MMT framing); nuclear power position evolved (initially skeptical, more open recently). Natural gas bridge fuel position unclear.

### Issue: medicare-for-all

**Position:** Strong support for single-payer Medicare for All. Opposes incremental ACA fixes as insufficient. Frames as moral imperative and economic efficiency.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Co-sponsor Medicare for All Act]** - Multiple Congresses - Congress.gov
- **[Town hall, July 2024]** - "Private insurance is a for-profit system that kills people. We need Medicare for All" - YouTube

### Issue: israel-palestine

**Position:** Supports Palestinian self-determination and statehood. Opposes Israeli settlements and military operations in Gaza/West Bank. Calls for conditioning U.S. aid on human rights. Frames as anti-apartheid, not anti-Israel. Opposes BDS officially but defends free speech on it.

- **[Statement, Oct 2023]** - Condemned Hamas attack, called for ceasefire, opposed collective punishment of Palestinians - Press release
- **[Vote, Feb 2024]** - Opposed Israel aid package without conditions - Congress.gov

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific two-state solution details not always explicit; primary emphasis on ending occupation and conditioning aid. Position evolved on framing (walks back "apartheid state" language sometimes). Security guarantee specifics for Israel in final deal unclear.

### Issue: police-criminal-justice-reform

**Position:** Supports "defund the police" as reallocation to social services, not abolition. Opposes qualified immunity. Supports ending cash bail, decriminalizing marijuana, prison reform. Frames as addressing root causes of crime (poverty, lack of opportunity).

**Confidence:** medium-high

**Evidence:**
- **[Interview, June 2020]** - "Defund the police means reallocating funds to healthcare, education, housing - things that keep us safe" - The Intercept

## Constraints & Budgets

### Political Capital

**Current:** high within progressive base; medium within full Democratic caucus

**Burn Rate:** high (spends capital frequently on messaging, advocacy)

**Constraints:**
- Must balance being team player (vote with Dems on final passage) with pushing left (amendments, messaging)
- Massive national profile creates scrutiny (every vote analyzed)
- Not in formal leadership limits institutional power

### Attention Budget

**Current:** severely constrained (national figure, massive media demands)

**Major Commitments:**
- Committee work (Oversight, Financial Services)
- Floor votes and speeches
- Social media presence (daily, high engagement)
- Media interviews and appearances (weekly)
- Constituent services (NY-14)
- Fundraising for allies (constant)
- Progressive movement events (rallies, town halls)

### Procedural Constraints

**Calendar:**
- Congressional schedule plus constant travel for movement events
- Social media requires daily attention (but also amplifies impact)

**Rules:**
- Single member, no committee chair power
- Minority party limits legislative vehicles
- Leadership not always receptive to progressive amendments

**Caucus Pressure:**
- Progressive base expects bold advocacy
- Democratic leadership expects party loyalty on key votes
- Must navigate tension between both

---

## Behavioral Tendencies

### Rhetoric Style

**Patterns:**
- Direct, accessible language (avoids political jargon)
- Frames issues in moral and justice terms
- Uses social media natively (Instagram stories, Twitter threads)
- Incorporates personal narrative (working-class background, bartender experience)
- Emphasizes systemic analysis (capitalism, racism, patriarchy as root causes)
- Engages critics directly, doesn't ignore attacks
- Uses humor and pop culture references effectively

**Media strategy:**
- Social media first (controls narrative, direct to followers)
- Progressive media (The Intercept, Jacobin, Democracy Now!)
- Mainstream media (CNN, MSNBC when strategic)
- Avoids Fox News typically
- Live-streams events and town halls (transparency, engagement)
- Uses viral moments strategically (committee clips, floor speeches designed for social media)

### Coalition Building

**Historical patterns:**
- Builds coalitions around issues, not institutions
- Focuses on grassroots pressure and outside game
- Uses primary challenges as leverage (sometimes threatens, sometimes endorses challengers)
- Works with centrists on final passage but pushes left publicly
- Fundraises for progressive challengers and incumbents
- Coordinates with movement organizations (Sunrise, DSA, Justice Democrats)

### Procedural Moves

**Preferred tactics:**
- Floor speeches and amendments for messaging (even if lose)
- Committee hearings for viral moments (questioning witnesses)
- Social media campaigns to pressure leadership
- Primary threats as leverage (rarely executed, often implied)
- Coalition letters with Squad and Progressive Caucus
- Outside mobilization (rallies, town halls) to create pressure

**Avoids:**
- Blocking must-pass bills (shutdown threats)
- Voting against final Democratic bills (party loyalty on passage)
- Quiet insider deal-making (prefers public advocacy)

### Risk Tolerance

**Level:** high

**Evidence:**
- Willing to vote against leadership (Biden, Pelosi, Jeffries on some issues)
- Uses controversial framing ("defund police," "apartheid") despite political backlash
- Engages Twitter fights with powerful figures (Cruz, Graham, etc.)
- Supported primary challenges to incumbents (controversial in party)
- But: Generally votes with Dems on final passage (not a chaos agent)

## Simulation Hooks

### Pheromone Emissions (Typical)

- `progressive_position_statement` - When staking out left position on issue (weekly)
- `social_media_amplification` - When viral moment creates narrative shift (variable)
- `committee_hearing_moment` - When questioning creates news (monthly during session)
- `squad_coordination_signal` - When coordinating with progressive bloc (as needed)
- `grassroots_pressure_campaign` - When mobilizing outside pressure on leadership (sporadic)
- `fundraising_for_allies` - When directing small-dollar donations to aligned candidates (constant)

### Response Patterns

- When `republican_partisan_bill` detected → Vote NO, amplify opposition on social media
- When `democratic_compromise_bill` detected → Assess if acceptable; vote YES on passage but criticize insufficient ambition
- When `progressive_priority_blocked` detected → Public advocacy, media campaign, pressure leadership
- When `viral_moment_opportunity` detected → Amplify on social media, turn into narrative

### Veto Points

**Limited formal power, but:**
- Can withhold vote on close margins (rarely, but potential leverage)
- Can create media storms that complicate leadership plans
- Can primary-threaten moderates (mostly implicit)
- Can redirect small-dollar fundraising away from moderates

### Amplification Factors

- **Social media reach:** 15M+ combined followers, high engagement
- **Media interest:** Everything she does is news (celebrity status)
- **Progressive movement:** Connected to grassroots organizations that can mobilize
- **Fundraising:** Small-dollar powerhouse, can redirect millions to allies
- **Cultural influence:** Pop culture figure beyond politics (fashion, music, crossover appeal)

## Metadata

**Data Sources:**
- Congress.gov (voting record, bill sponsorships)
- C-SPAN (floor speeches, hearings)
- @AOC Twitter/X and Instagram (primary communications channel)
- Progressive media (The Intercept, Jacobin, Democracy Now!)
- Mainstream media interviews (CNN, MSNBC, NY Times)
- Town halls and rallies (YouTube, local press)

**Last Evidence Date:** October 2024

**Confidence Score:** high
- High confidence on Green New Deal, Medicare for All, immigration (signature issues, consistent)
- High confidence on Israel-Palestine (clear record despite evolution)
- Medium-high confidence on police reform (framing evolved, less emphasis recently)
- Medium confidence on tactical compromises (votes with Dems on final passage but public stance varies)

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Update if relationship with Jeffries shifts (currently cordial but distant)
- Monitor Israel-Palestine position (evolving, politically fraught)
- Track any leadership ambitions (ran for leadership, could again)
- Check for primary challenges she endorses (signals priorities and relationships)
