## Stance Graph

### Issue: immigration-border-security

**Position:** Strong support for increased border enforcement, physical barriers, and strict asylum limits. Opposes pathways to citizenship without border security first. Links border security to national security and fentanyl crisis.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[House Floor Speech, Oct 2023]** - "We will not pass any legislation that does not secure our border first" - C-SPAN
- **[Fox News Interview, Sept 2024]** - "The border crisis is a national security crisis. Fentanyl is pouring across, cartels are operating with impunity" - Fox News
- **[Voted YES on H.R. 2]** - Secure the Border Act (May 2023), comprehensive border enforcement bill - Congress.gov
- **[Press Release, Aug 2024]** - "Biden's open border policies have created chaos. House Republicans will force accountability" - Speaker.gov

**Uncertainty Notes:** Has not explicitly addressed DACA renewals or Dreamers pathway; general rhetoric suggests opposition to legalization without security, but no direct statement on DACA specifically. Unclear position on temporary worker visa expansion.

### Issue: fiscal-spending-fy2025

**Position:** Supports spending cuts and deficit reduction, but pragmatically accepts continuing resolutions to avoid shutdown. Faces pressure from defense hawks (increase) and fiscal conservatives (cut).

**Confidence:** medium

**Evidence:**
- **[Conference remarks, July 2024]** - "We must get our fiscal house in order, but we cannot endanger national security" - Politico
- **[Negotiated CR, Sept 2024]** - Agreed to short-term continuing resolution with modest cuts rather than force shutdown - Roll Call
- **[Budget Committee testimony, June 2024]** - Called for "responsible spending restraint" but acknowledged defense needs - Committee transcript

**Uncertainty Notes:** Rhetoric emphasizes cuts, but actions show pragmatism. Unclear how aggressively he'll push cuts vs. maintaining majority unity. Defense spending vs. domestic cuts trade-off not fully defined.

### Issue: ukraine-aid

**Position:** Initially skeptical of additional Ukraine aid; evolved to conditional support with accountability measures and border security linkage.

**Confidence:** medium

**Evidence:**
- **[Statement, Feb 2024]** - "Any Ukraine aid must be paired with border security and accountability for how funds are spent" - The Hill
- **[Voted YES on Ukraine aid package, April 2024]** - After negotiating accountability provisions - Congress.gov
- **[Interview, March 2024]** - "I'm not a blank check guy. We need metrics, oversight, endgame strategy" - CNN

**Uncertainty Notes:** Position appears to shift based on conference pressure and geopolitical events. Unclear if this represents genuine evolution or political maneuvering. Taiwan aid appears less controversial for him than Ukraine.

### Issue: abortion-federal-policy

**Position:** Personally pro-life; supports state-level determination post-Dobbs; cautious about federal ban due to political risks.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Historical record]** - 100% pro-life voting record in previous Congress terms - NRLC scorecard
- **[Interview, Nov 2023]** - "Dobbs returned this to the states, where it belongs. That's the right constitutional outcome" - Christian Broadcasting Network
- **[Declined to advance federal ban, March 2024]** - Did not bring 15-week ban to floor despite Freedom Caucus pressure - Washington Post

**Uncertainty Notes:** Personal pro-life conviction clear, but strategic calculus on federal legislation ambiguous. May be threading needle between caucus ideology and electoral vulnerability in purple districts.

## Constraints & Budgets

### Political Capital

**Current:** medium-high (as of Oct 2024)

**Burn Rate:** medium (regularly spending capital on CR negotiations, border bills)

**Constraints:**
- Cannot alienate Freedom Caucus (they can threaten motion to vacate)
- Cannot lose moderate purple-district Republicans (electoral vulnerability)
- Must deliver wins for 2024 election narrative

### Attention Budget

**Current:** severely constrained

**Major Commitments:**
- Appropriations process (daily attention through Dec 2024)
- Border crisis response (weekly media, coordination with governors)
- Conference management (daily whip operations, member meetings)
- Impeachment inquiries (periodic hearings, oversight)
- Floor proceedings (3-4 days/week when in session)

### Procedural Constraints

**Calendar:**
- House in session ~140 days/year; significant recess periods
- FY2025 appropriations deadline: Sept 30, 2024 (missed; now on CR)
- Next CR expiry: Dec 20, 2024
- Election recess: Oct-Nov 2024

**Rules:**
- Hastert Rule (informal): Don't bring bills that lack majority-of-majority support
- Motion to vacate: Single member can force vote on Speaker removal (post-2023 rules change)
- Committee jurisdiction: Must respect committee authority, can't bypass entirely

**Caucus Pressure:**
- Weekly Republican Conference meetings (must maintain unity messaging)
- Freedom Caucus demands: Regular meetings, commitments on procedures and priorities
- Moderate Tuesday Group: Quiet but essential votes; less vocal but must not lose them

---

## Behavioral Tendencies

### Rhetoric Style

**Patterns:**
- Emphasizes constitutional principles and institutional norms
- Uses Christian conservative framing (personal faith is public)
- Frames GOP positions as "common sense" vs. "extreme" Democratic policies
- Measured tone compared to bomb-throwers; more institutionalist
- Frequently invokes Founders and constitutional history

**Media strategy:**
- Fox News, conservative outlets primary venues
- Occasional mainstream media (CNN, network Sunday shows) for major announcements
- Active on social media (Twitter/X) but less bombastic than predecessors
- Prefers prepared remarks over freewheeling pressers

### Coalition Building

**Historical patterns:**
- Won Speakership as consensus compromise after Scalise and Jordan failed
- Builds coalitions through one-on-one member meetings (time-intensive)
- Relies on committee chairs and leadership team (delegates operational work)
- Uses procedural concessions to Freedom Caucus to secure votes
- Seeks quiet bipartisan deals on must-pass bills (CR, debt limit) rather than public spectacle

### Procedural Moves

**Preferred tactics:**
- Continuing resolutions over shutdown brinkmanship (learned from past GOP losses)
- Rules Committee to structure debate favorably (limit amendments)
- Use reconciliation process for partisan priorities (budget, tax)
- Coordinate with governors and state AGs for federalism pressure campaigns
- Threaten oversight/impeachment as leverage with Executive

**Avoids:**
- Government shutdowns (political liability)
- Public intra-conference fights (projects disunity)
- Overriding Senate or bucking McConnell without strong reason

### Risk Tolerance

**Level:** medium-low

**Evidence:**
- Chose CR over shutdown fight (Sept-Oct 2024) - risk-averse
- Negotiated Ukraine aid compromise rather than block entirely - pragmatic
- Has not forced votes on bills destined to fail in Senate - avoids symbolic losses
- But: Willing to pursue impeachment inquiries despite political risk - shows calculation that base demands it

## Simulation Hooks

### Pheromone Emissions (Typical)

- `floor_schedule_update` - When setting House calendar (weekly)
- `whip_count_request` - When testing support for bill (pre-vote)
- `conference_guidance` - When setting party-line expectations (weekly conference meetings)
- `coalition_offer` - When negotiating with factions or across aisle (as needed)
- `appropriations_deadline_warning` - When CR or spending deadlines approach (monthly)
- `leadership_meeting_called` - When convening Big Four or bipartisan negotiations (sporadic)

### Response Patterns

- When `government_shutdown_risk` detected → Increase CR negotiation activity, meet with Biden/Schumer
- When `freedom_caucus_revolt` detected → One-on-one meetings, procedural concessions, delay floor votes
- When `border_crisis_event` detected → Amplify messaging, coordinate with border-state governors, demand Biden action
- When `senate_bill_passed` detected → Assess House appetite, negotiate differences or table

### Veto Points

- **Floor scheduling:** Can prevent bill from reaching floor indefinitely
- **Rules Committee:** Can structure debate to kill or advantage bills
- **Conference committee appointments:** Can influence bicameral negotiations
- **Committee assignments:** Can reward/punish members with committee posts

### Amplification Factors

- **Media megaphone:** Speaker gets automatic national media attention
- **Fundraising:** Can direct party money to vulnerable members (loyalty incentive)
- **Institutional prestige:** Members want Speaker's favor for own priorities
- **Agenda control:** Setting the House agenda shapes national conversation

## Metadata

**Data Sources:**
- Congress.gov (voting record, bill sponsorships)
- C-SPAN (floor speeches, hearings)
- Speaker.gov (official press releases, statements)
- Major media interviews (Fox News, CNN, Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Washington Post)
- Congressional Leadership Fund (aligned super PAC communications)

**Last Evidence Date:** October 2024

**Confidence Score:** medium-high
- High confidence on border security, abortion (clear record)
- Medium confidence on fiscal/Ukraine (evolving positions, pragmatic shifts)
- Lower confidence on some procedural strategies (learning role, adapting)

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Update post-FY2025 appropriations resolution (Dec 2024 expected)
- Monitor Freedom Caucus relationship (could shift)
- Track any bipartisan deal-making (would update coalition patterns)
- Check for major floor defeats (would impact political capital assessment)
