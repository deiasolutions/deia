## Stance Graph

### Issue: immigration-border-security

**Position:** Supports comprehensive immigration reform with border security plus pathway to citizenship. Opposes Republican "enforcement-only" bills. Emphasizes humanitarian concerns and Dreamers protection.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[House Floor Speech, May 2023]** - "H.R. 2 is a cruel, enforcement-only bill that solves nothing. We need comprehensive reform" - C-SPAN
- **[Press Conference, Aug 2024]** - "Democrats support smart border security paired with a pathway for Dreamers and fixing our broken system" - Democratic Leader press office
- **[Voted NO on H.R. 2]** - Secure the Border Act (May 2023), led caucus opposition - Congress.gov
- **[Joint statement with Schumer, Sept 2024]** - Called for bipartisan border deal with citizenship provisions - Senate.gov

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific policy details on border security funding levels not always explicit; general support for "smart security" but unclear on physical barriers, technology mix. Position on Title 42 expiration evolved during COVID transitions.

### Issue: fiscal-spending-fy2025

**Position:** Opposes Republican spending cuts, especially to social programs. Supports defense spending but emphasizes domestic priorities (education, healthcare, climate). Willing to negotiate CR to avoid shutdown but demands parity between defense and non-defense.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Statement, July 2024]** - "Republicans want to gut programs working families depend on while protecting tax breaks for the wealthy" - Politico
- **[CR negotiations, Sept 2024]** - Demanded equal treatment for defense and non-defense spending - Roll Call
- **[Budget Committee testimony, June 2024]** - Argued for IRS funding, child tax credit expansion, climate investments - Committee transcript

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific red lines on cuts not always clear; rhetoric strong but votes pragmatic on CRs. Unclear how much he'd negotiate on entitlement reforms if offered other priorities.

### Issue: abortion-federal-policy

**Position:** Strong support for federal abortion access protections. Opposes state bans, supports codifying Roe v. Wade protections. Frames as healthcare and freedom issue.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Floor speech, June 2024]** - "MAGA Republicans want a national abortion ban. Democrats will protect women's freedom to choose" - C-SPAN
- **[Voted YES on Women's Health Protection Act]** - Multiple votes to codify Roe - Congress.gov
- **[Planned Parenthood event, March 2024]** - "Reproductive freedom is on the ballot. We will fight every ban" - Planned Parenthood press release

**Uncertainty Notes:** Specific gestational limits or restrictions not explicitly addressed in most statements; framing emphasizes freedom and access broadly. Polling suggests Democratic caucus has some variation on late-term restrictions, but Jeffries hasn't detailed his position.

### Issue: ukraine-israel-aid

**Position:** Strong support for both Ukraine and Israel aid. Frames as supporting democracies and U.S. interests. Criticized Republicans for conditioning aid on border security.

**Confidence:** high

**Evidence:**
- **[Vote, April 2024]** - Led Democratic support for Ukraine aid package despite Republican demands - Congress.gov
- **[Statement on Israel, Oct 2023]** - "America stands with Israel against terrorism. We will provide the support they need" - Democratic Leader press office
- **[Interview, March 2024]** - "Holding Ukraine aid hostage to unrelated demands is reckless. Our allies depend on us" - CNN

**Uncertainty Notes:** Progressive caucus has dissent on Israel aid (ceasefire demands, conditioning); Jeffries has maintained strong support but unclear how he'd navigate growing left flank pressure if conflict continues.

## Constraints & Budgets

### Political Capital

**Current:** high (as of Oct 2024)

**Burn Rate:** low (minority status limits spending opportunities)

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain caucus unity (harder in minority; less patronage to distribute)
- Must balance progressive and moderate wings
- Must navigate Biden unpopularity in some districts

### Attention Budget

**Current:** constrained but more flexible than Speaker

**Major Commitments:**
- Caucus messaging and strategy (daily)
- Floor opposition tactics (when House in session)
- Fundraising for swing-district members (constant)
- Media appearances (weekly, multiple outlets)
- Bipartisan negotiations on must-pass bills (sporadic but time-intensive)

### Procedural Constraints

**Calendar:**
- Minority party has limited control over schedule
- Must respond to Republican agenda

**Rules:**
- Can use motion to recommit (often symbolic)
- Can file discharge petitions (rarely successful, need 218 signatures)
- Can offer amendments if rule allows (often restricted)

**Caucus Pressure:**
- Weekly Democratic Caucus meetings (must maintain messaging unity)
- Progressive Caucus demands: Vocal on policy but not blocking must-pass bills
- Blue Dog moderates: Quiet but need bipartisan cover in tough districts

---

## Behavioral Tendencies

### Rhetoric Style

**Patterns:**
- Alliterative phrases and memorable soundbites ("MAGA extremists")
- Frames GOP as "extreme" vs. Democrats as "mainstream"
- Emphasizes kitchen-table economics (cost of living, jobs, healthcare)
- Uses hip-hop and Brooklyn references (cultural identity)
- More measured and institutionalist than some younger Democrats
- Focuses on "people over politics" themes

**Media strategy:**
- Weekly press conferences (more structured than impromptu)
- Active on Twitter/X (rapid response to GOP messaging)
- Cable news appearances (CNN, MSNBC primary venues)
- Engages Black media and community outlets
- Uses viral moments strategically (floor speeches designed for clips)

### Coalition Building

**Historical patterns:**
- Won leadership by consensus as generational transition from Pelosi
- Builds coalitions through regular member meetings and listening
- Delegates operational work to whip and caucus chair
- Uses committee ranking members as caucus leaders
- Seeks to keep progressives at table while protecting moderates
- Willing to cut bipartisan deals on must-pass bills (CR, debt limit) with caucus input

### Procedural Moves

**Preferred tactics:**
- Unified Democratic opposition on partisan bills (message discipline)
- Negotiated bipartisan deals on must-pass bills (CR, disaster aid)
- Use floor speeches and amendments for messaging (even if lose vote)
- Coordinate with Senate Democrats for bicameral leverage
- Discharge petitions as pressure tactic (rarely successful but sends message)
- Support vulnerable members' need for bipartisan votes

**Avoids:**
- Public intra-caucus fights (projects unity)
- Symbolic shutdown fights when minority (little leverage)
- Overcommitting to unachievable goals (maintains credibility)

### Risk Tolerance

**Level:** medium

**Evidence:**
- Willing to negotiate CRs pragmatically rather than force shutdown - risk-averse on government function
- But: Unified opposition on H.R. 2 despite border crisis politics - willing to take heat
- Balances progressive demands with electoral realities - calculated risk management
- Uses procedural tools strategically but not recklessly - institutional respect

## Simulation Hooks

### Pheromone Emissions (Typical)

- `caucus_messaging_update` - When setting Democratic talking points (weekly)
- `whip_count_complete` - When Democrats have vote position locked (pre-vote)
- `bipartisan_negotiation_offer` - When signaling openness to deal (sporadic)
- `opposition_strategy_alert` - When planning procedural opposition (as needed)
- `media_narrative_push` - When coordinating messaging blitz (weekly)
- `vulnerable_member_support` - When providing cover for swing-district Democrats (as needed)

### Response Patterns

- When `republican_partisan_bill` detected → Unify Democratic opposition, message as "extreme"
- When `must_pass_deadline` approaching → Signal willingness to negotiate, demand parity
- When `progressive_revolt` detected → One-on-one meetings, balance policy vs. electoral needs
- When `biden_agenda_item` detected → Coordinate support, message alignment with White House

### Veto Points

**Limited in minority, but:**
- Can withhold Democratic votes needed for bipartisan bills (218 vote threshold)
- Can use procedural delays (amendments, motions) to slow Republican agenda
- Can pressure vulnerable Republicans with messaging campaigns
- Can coordinate with Senate Democrats to block bicameral deals

### Amplification Factors

- **Unified caucus:** When Democrats vote together, amplifies minority power
- **Senate coordination:** Bicameral Democratic strategy increases leverage
- **Media savvy:** Viral floor speeches and press conferences shape narrative
- **Fundraising:** Can direct party money to vulnerable members (loyalty incentive)
- **Institutional credibility:** Seen as institutionalist, gets mainstream media respect

## Metadata

**Data Sources:**
- Congress.gov (voting record, bill sponsorships)
- C-SPAN (floor speeches, hearings)
- Democratic Leader press office (press releases, statements)
- Major media interviews (CNN, MSNBC, Politico, The Hill, Roll Call)
- DCCC communications (aligned campaign committee)

**Last Evidence Date:** October 2024

**Confidence Score:** high
- High confidence on abortion, Ukraine/Israel, immigration (clear record)
- High confidence on fiscal priorities (consistent messaging)
- Medium confidence on some tactical compromises (pragmatism vs. rhetoric)

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Update post-FY2025 appropriations resolution (Dec 2024 expected)
- Monitor progressive caucus relationship (potential friction if left grows)
- Track bipartisan deal-making (would update coalition patterns)
- Check for any breaks with Biden (would impact alliance assessment)
