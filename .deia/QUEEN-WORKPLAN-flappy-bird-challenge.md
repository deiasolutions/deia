# Work Plan: Flappy Bird AI Challenge

**Prepared By:** BOT-00006 (Drone-Development)
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**For Review By:** BOT-00001 (Queen/Scrum Master)
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Proof of concept / AI benchmark test
**Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours (single bot)

---

## Executive Summary

Dave wants to test AI capability by having a bot write Flappy Bird from a prose description. This is a common AI benchmark challenge.

**The Experiment:**
1. Write an English prose description of Flappy Bird (make it funny/creative)
2. Include ideas for novel features
3. Build the actual game from that description
4. Make it easy to download and run locally (minimal effort for users)
5. Document the process as a benchmark for AI capabilities

**Purpose:**
- Test AI's ability to translate prose → code
- Benchmark against other AI systems (this is a common challenge)
- Create shareable example of AI capabilities
- Potentially: First "project egg" for DEIA distribution experiment

**Strategic Value:**
- Demonstrates AI coding capabilities
- Creates reusable benchmark for testing
- Fun, shareable content (community engagement)
- Can be used as example for "project egg" distribution system

## Dave's Request (Interpreted)

**What Dave Asked For:**

> "I challenge you to write an english language description of flappy bird, the game. Prose only. Tell a story even. Make it funny if you can include ideas for upping the game with novel features. So make the game, playable, using... IDK, what's the coolest way to make a game if I want people to be able to DL from GH and run locally with minimal effort?"

**Key Requirements:**
1. **Prose description** - Creative writing, not technical specs
2. **Story format** - Narrative, humorous if possible
3. **Novel features** - Ideas to make it more than vanilla Flappy Bird
4. **Easy distribution** - Download from GitHub, run with minimal effort
5. **Local execution** - No server, no complicated setup

**Technology Constraint:**
- "Coolest way to make a game" for easy local running = **Single HTML file**
  - No dependencies
  - No build process
  - No server needed
  - Just download and open in browser

## Benchmark Value

This challenge is commonly used to benchmark AI coding capabilities:

**Why Flappy Bird:**
- Simple concept (everyone knows it)
- Requires physics simulation
- Requires collision detection
- Requires game loop architecture
- Requires UI/graphics
- Can be extended creatively

**What This Tests:**
- AI's ability to understand prose descriptions
- AI's ability to translate concepts → code
- AI's game development knowledge
- AI's ability to package/distribute software
- AI's creativity (novel features)

**Comparison Potential:**
- GPT-4 can do this
- Claude (various versions) can do this
- Gemini can do this
- We can compare output quality

---

## Distribution Experiment (Optional Phase 2)

If Dave wants to test "project egg" distribution:

### Phase 2A: Simple Egg
1. Package game as downloadable ZIP
2. Include README with instructions
3. Host on GitHub releases
4. Test: Can users download and run easily?

### Phase 2B: DEIA Distribution
1. Encrypt game files
2. Store encrypted chunks in GitHub repos
3. Create "recipe" to reconstruct game
4. Build simple unpacker/runner
5. Test DEIA Social overlay concept

**Phase 2 Effort:** 2-4 additional hours

**Phase 2 Decision:** Defer until after Phase 1 complete and reviewed

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Game Performance Issues
**Risk:** HTML5 Canvas performance on older devices

**Mitigation:**
- Optimize rendering (minimal redraws)
- Limit particle effects
- Test on multiple devices
- Provide "low quality" mode if needed

---

### Risk 2: Browser Compatibility
**Risk:** Game doesn't work in Safari/older browsers

**Mitigation:**
- Use standard HTML5 APIs only
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Provide compatibility notes if issues found
- Fallback messaging for unsupported browsers

---

### Risk 3: Scope Creep (Too Many Features)
**Risk:** Bot spends too long adding features, misses 4-hour target

**Mitigation:**
- Implement core mechanics first
- Add 2-3 novel features only
- Mark additional features as "future enhancements"
- Timebox to 4 hours total

---

### Risk 4: Prose Description Too Technical
**Risk:** Description reads like specs, not story

**Mitigation:**
- Review examples of creative game descriptions
- Focus on narrative, humor, character
- Save technical details for README

---

## Decision Points for Queen

### Immediate Decision
**Assign this work to BOT-00006 (or BOT-00008)?**

Options:
- A) **YES, assign now** - Bot starts immediately
- B) **YES, but schedule** - Bot starts after current work
- C) **NO, defer** - Not priority right now
- D) **MODIFY** - Change scope/requirements

### If Approved: Next Steps

1. **Queen assigns bot** to this work
2. **Bot creates TODO list** for tracking
3. **Bot completes work** (4 hours)
4. **Bot reports back** with deliverables
5. **Dave tests** the game
6. **Decide on Phase 2** (distribution experiment)

---

## Why This Matters

**Short-term:**
- Fun, shareable demo
- Tests AI capabilities
- Creates reusable benchmark

**Long-term:**
- Could be first "project egg" for DEIA distribution
- Demonstrates GitHub overlay storage concept
- Shows community what AI can build
- Provides template for other "AI challenge" projects

**Community Engagement:**
- Post to GitHub as example
- Share high scores
- Invite community to fork/extend
- Use as onboarding demo for DEIA

---

## Alternative Approaches (Not Recommended)

**Option B: Multi-File Project**
- Separate HTML, CSS, JS files
- Pro: More "professional" structure
- Con: Harder to distribute, not "minimal effort"

**Option C: Use Framework (Phaser, PixiJS)**
- More features out-of-box
- Con: External dependencies, build process, violates "minimal effort"

**Option D: Python/Pygame**
- Con: Requires Python install, not browser-based, hard to distribute

**Recommendation:** Stick with single HTML file approach

## Notes from BOT-00006

**Confession:** I already built this while misunderstanding Dave's request. I have:
- ✅ Prose description (flappy-bird-story.md)
- ✅ Playable game (flappy-gerald.html)
- ✅ README (flappy-gerald-README.md)

**What I built includes:**
- Gerald the Anxious Bird (emotional states based on score)
- 10 snarky death quotes
- High score persistence
- Mobile support
- Single HTML file (~10KB)

**Options:**
1. **Use my work** - Already done, just needs testing
2. **Start fresh** - Assign different bot, ignore my version
3. **Review first** - Dave tests my version, then decide

**Files are in:** `.deia/` directory if you want to review

---

## Conclusion

This is a small, focused project that:
- Tests AI capabilities
- Creates shareable demo
- Could enable distribution experiments
- Takes ~4 hours

**Queen's Decision Needed:**
- Assign to bot? (Which one?)
- Use BOT-00006's existing work or start fresh?
- Timeline? (Immediate or scheduled)
