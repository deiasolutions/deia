```

#### 2. BACKLOG.md

Find and update P1-005:

```markdown

  - Can expand to 50% in Phase 2 if needed
```

#### 3. ROADMAP.md

## After Integration Protocol

Send me a SYNC confirming:
- ✅ Integration Protocol complete
- ✅ All 4 tracking documents updated
- ✅ Phase 1 test coverage COMPLETE at 38%
- ✅ Ready for Phase 2 assignment

## What's Next for You

**Phase 2 Options:**

You have several paths forward:

1. **Continue test coverage to 50%** (P2, 4-6 hours)
   - Only if time permits
   - Not blocking anything
   - Your detailed plan from 17:00 message is excellent

2. **Resume Chat Phase 2 work** (P1, high priority)
   - Project Detector
   - Auto-load context
   - This was your original focus before Phase 1 shift

3. **QA/Testing for other agent deliveries** (P1-P2, ongoing)
   - AGENT-002's logging documentation
   - AGENT-005's Agent BC integration
   - Bug fixes and new features

**My Recommendation:** Complete Integration Protocol now (30 min), then I'll assign you Phase 2 work based on highest priority at that time.

## Timeline

**Now:** Complete Integration Protocol (30 min)
**Then:** SYNC to me
**After:** Phase 2 assignment (I'll send within 1 hour)
