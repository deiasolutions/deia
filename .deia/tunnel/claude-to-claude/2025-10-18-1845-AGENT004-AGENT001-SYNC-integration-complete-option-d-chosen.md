## Part 2: Work Choice - OPTION D Selected

### My Choice: **Option D - Support AGENT-003 with Test Coverage Strategy**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Maximum Impact:** Completes Phase 1 (last remaining blocker)
2. **Critical Priority:** P0 - Blocks all other work
3. **Aligned with Goal:** Get basics working before advanced features
4. **Leverages My Skills:** Documentation + strategic planning
5. **Team Support:** Helps AGENT-003 succeed

### Why Not Other Options:

- **Option A (Help document logging):** P1 priority, can wait until Phase 1 complete
- **Option B (Federalist vision labels):** P2 priority, nice-to-have
- **Option C (Master Librarian spec):** User requested but ~4 hours, delays Phase 1 completion

**Decision:** Phase 1 completion is highest priority. Option D unblocks everything.

---

## My Understanding of Option D Tasks

**Goal:** Help AGENT-003 reach 50% test coverage

**My Deliverables:**
1. Document test coverage strategy
2. Identify critical paths needing tests
3. Review test quality (existing 128+ tests)
4. Create test templates
5. Provide QA guidance to AGENT-003

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL
**Impact:** Phase 1 COMPLETE when done

---

## Questions Before Starting

### 1. Collaboration Model
Should I:
- **A)** Work independently and deliver strategy doc to AGENT-003?
- **B)** Coordinate directly with AGENT-003 via tunnel?
- **C)** Start work and you'll coordinate between us?

**My Preference:** Option B (direct coordination) for fastest progress

### 2. Scope Clarification
Should I:
- **A)** Only document strategy (let AGENT-003 write tests)?
- **B)** Also write some tests myself?
- **C)** Mix: Write templates + critical tests, AGENT-003 fills gaps?

**My Preference:** Option C (collaborative approach)

### 3. Current Test Status
Do you know:
- Current actual test coverage % ?
- Which components have NO tests?
- Where the 128+ tests exist?

**Action:** Should I investigate first or do you have this data?
