# TASK: Read Your BC Liaison Role Specification

**From:** CLAUDE-CODE-001 (Left Brain Coordinator)
**To:** CLAUDE-CODE-005 (Full-Stack Generalist & Agent BC Liaison)
**Date:** 2025-10-18 1005 CDT
**Priority:** P1 - HIGH (Role clarity)
**Estimated:** 15 minutes

---

## Context

Per user request, I've documented your role as **Agent BC Liaison**.

This is your **permanent assignment** going forward:
- You are the **exclusive liaison** between DEIA project and Agent BC
- You handle **ALL Agent BC integration work**
- You coordinate **inbound/outbound messaging** with Agent BC (through user)

---

## Your Task

**Read your role specification:**

📄 **File:** `.deia/specifications/AGENT-005-BC-LIAISON-ROLE-SPEC.md` (VERSION 2.0)

**CRITICAL: Your role is COORDINATION, not integration!**

**This document defines:**

1. **Who is Agent BC** (external agent via Claude.ai, EXTREMELY FAST: 19 components in 95 min)
2. **Your 5 primary responsibilities:**
   - **BC Work Coordination** (triage deliveries, assign integration to OTHER agents)
   - **Work Planning & Breakdown** (break large features into BC-sized chunks for me)
   - **Inbound/Outbound Messaging** (keep BC fed with next jobs)
   - **Line of Sight Maintenance** (always know BC's current/upcoming work)
   - **Integration Assignment** (delegate to AGENT-002/003/004, NOT do yourself)
3. **What you DO:** Coordinate, plan, track, assign, compile feedback
4. **What you DON'T do:** Integration work (unless specifically assigned by me)
5. **Standard workflows** (delivery processing, work breakdown, feedback loop)
6. **Communication protocols** (to me, to user, to integration agents)
7. **Success metrics** (BC pipeline never empty, integration flowing smoothly)

---

## Why This Matters

**Historical Context:**
- Agent BC delivered 19 components on 2025-10-17
- AGENT-003 integrated Phases 1 & 2 (as part of QA role)
- AGENT-003 shifted to test coverage work (Phase 1 priority)
- **You inherited Agent BC work** as permanent assignment

**Current Status:**
- Phase 3 awaiting your integration (3 components)
- You were assigned this on 2025-10-18 (task at 16:45 UTC / should be ~11:45 CDT)
- User wants clear role definition for you
- Future Agent BC phases (4, 5, 6...) will all come to you

---

## After Reading the Spec

**Take these actions:**

### 1. Confirm Understanding (5 min)

Send SYNC to me confirming:
- ✅ Read and understood role spec
- ✅ Clear on 4 primary responsibilities
- ✅ Understand Agent BC integration workflow
- ✅ Know how to coordinate (SYNC to me, ALERT to user)
- ✅ Ready to begin Phase 3 integration

### 2. Update Your Current Task List (5 min)

Your current assignments:
1. **BUG-004 fix** (P1, 30 min) - safe_print unicode crash
2. **Agent BC Phase 3 integration** (P2, 3-4 hours) - BOK Validator, Health Check
3. **Future Agent BC work** (ongoing) - All future phases

### 3. Ask Questions (if any)

If anything in the spec is unclear, ask me now.

## Key Takeaways from the Spec

**You are the BC Project Manager - This means:**

✅ **Coordinate BC deliveries** (triage, assign integration to other agents)
✅ **Plan BC work** (break down large features into BC-sized chunks)
✅ **Maintain line of sight** (always know what BC is working on next)
✅ **Manage feedback loop** (compile results, feed back to BC)
✅ **Keep BC fed** (ensure BC always has next jobs queued)
✅ **Track integration** (monitor AGENT-002/003/004 integration progress)

**You are NOT:**
❌ Doing integration yourself (assign to AGENT-002/003/004)
❌ Communicating directly with Agent BC (goes through user)
❌ Making high-level prioritization (I decide that)

**Your value:** BC is FAST (19 components in 95 min). You keep deliverables flowing and BC's pipeline full. This takes planning work OFF MY PLATE.

**Historical Integration:**
- Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE (by AGENT-003, 2025-10-17) - 8 components
- Phase 2: ✅ COMPLETE (by AGENT-003, 2025-10-17) - 7 components
- Phase 3: ⏳ ASSIGNED to you (2025-10-18) - 3 components

## Integration Workflow Summary

**For each Agent BC component:**

1. **Intake:** Copy from Downloads → `.deia/intake/`, update MANIFEST.md
2. **Review:** QA for bugs/security, run Bug Fix Lookup Protocol
3. **Convert:** Rename .txt → .py/.md, fix imports, add types
4. **Test:** Write tests (>80% coverage), verify passing
5. **Document:** Create usage guides, update README
6. **Integrate:** Complete Integration Protocol (update 4 tracking docs)

**After each component:**
- SYNC to me (AGENT-001)
- ALERT to user (if feedback for Agent BC)

## REVISED: Your Current Phase 3 Task

**OLD TASK (CANCELLED):** Integration work assigned at 1645 CDT
**NEW TASK (THIS MESSAGE):** Coordination work

**Phase 3 Components:**
1. BOK Pattern Validator
2. Health Check System
3. Additional components TBD

**Location:** `.deia/intake/2025-10-17/agent-bc-phase3/`

**Your Job (30-60 min):**
1. Review Phase 3 components
2. Decide which agent integrates each:
   - BOK Validator → AGENT-002 (docs) or AGENT-004 (curation)?
   - Health Check → AGENT-003 (QA/testing)?
3. Create task assignments for chosen agents
4. Create coordination tracking files
5. SYNC to me with plan

**NOT:** Do the 3-4 hours of integration work yourself

**Next:** Confirm understanding via SYNC (5 min)
