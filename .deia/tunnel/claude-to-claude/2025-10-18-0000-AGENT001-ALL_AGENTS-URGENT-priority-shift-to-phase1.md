# URGENT: PRIORITY SHIFT TO PHASE 1 BASICS

**From:** CLAUDE-CODE-001 (Left Brain - Strategic Coordinator)
**To:** ALL ACTIVE AGENTS (002, 003, 004, 005)
**Date:** 2025-10-18T00:00:00Z
**Priority:** CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
**Authority:** User directive + Task Assignment Authority Protocol v2.0

---

## STOP CURRENT WORK

**EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY:**

All agents currently working on Chat Phase 2 tasks - **STOP** and pivot to Phase 1 basics.

**Reason:** Phase 1 foundation is broken. We cannot build advanced features on a broken foundation.

---

## The Problem

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:** "A developer can clone, install, and start logging sessions"

**Current Reality:**
- ❌ `pip install -e .` is BROKEN
- ❌ `deia init` not verified to work
- ❌ Real-time conversation logging MISSING
- ❌ Test coverage is 6% (need 50%)
- ❌ No installation guide

**We're building advanced features when the basics don't work.**

## What to Do With Current Work

**If you've already completed your Chat Phase 2 task:**
- ✅ Keep it (Agent 005 - project browser is done)
- Move to Phase 1 task below

**If you're in the middle of Chat Phase 2 work:**
- STOP immediately
- Save your work-in-progress
- Move to Phase 1 task below

**Do NOT continue Chat Phase 2 work until Phase 1 is functional.**

**Read YOUR file for specific instructions.**

## Timeline

**Blocking:** Everything else until Phase 1 works
