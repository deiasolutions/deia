# BOK Documentation Decisions - Claude Code Startup Success

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Context:** Successfully validated Claude Code startup protocol across 3 windows. Need to document for BOK and create demo post.

---

## Current Status

âœ… **Achievement Validated:** Claude Code reads `project_resume.md` and executes full startup sequence reliably
âœ… **Components Working:**
- `project_resume.md` â†’ Entry point
- `.claude/STARTUP.md` â†’ Executable instructions
- `.claude/STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md` â†’ Validation
- `.claude/REPO_INDEX.md` â†’ Navigation
- `.claude/INSTRUCTIONS.md` â†’ Auto-log behavior
- `~/.deia/dave/preferences.md` â†’ User preferences
- `ROADMAP.md` â†’ Project awareness
- `.deia/config.json` â†’ Runtime config

âœ… **User Validation:** Tested in 3 separate VS Code windows, consistent behavior

## Decisions Needed (Spoon-Feed Later)

### Decision 1: BOK Entry Structure

**Question:** How should we structure the BOK entry?

**Options to present:**

**Option A - Single Pattern**
```
Title: "Reliable Context Loading for Claude Code"
Location: bok/patterns/collaboration/reliable-context-loading.md
Focus: Abstract pattern applicable to any Claude Code project
```

**Option B - Multiple Related Patterns**
```
Pattern 1: "Session Resume Protocol" (project_resume.md approach)
Pattern 2: "Startup Checklist Pattern" (validation)
Pattern 3: "Configuration-Driven Behavior" (config checks)
```

**Option C - Platform-Specific Guide**
```
Title: "Reliable Startup for Claude Code"
Location: bok/platforms/claude-code/reliable-startup.md
Focus: Tutorial-style with copy-paste templates
```

**Prompt to use later:**
> "For the BOK entry on Claude Code startup, should we do:
>
> A) Single abstract pattern (works for any project)
> B) Multiple related patterns (session resume, startup checklist, config-driven)
> C) Platform-specific tutorial (Claude Code focused, more practical)
>
> Just give me A, B, or C."

---

### Decision 2: Audience Split

**Question:** Should we create separate versions for DEIA vs non-DEIA users?

**Options to present:**

**Option A - Single Universal Version**
```
One BOK entry with DEIA-specific sections clearly marked
Non-DEIA users skip those sections
Example: "# Optional: DEIA Integration"
```

**Option B - Two Separate Entries**
```
Entry 1: "Claude Code Reliable Startup" (generic, no DEIA)
Entry 2: "DEIA Auto-Logging for Claude Code" (full integration)
```

**Option C - Generic with DEIA Example**
```
Main entry: Generic startup protocol
Separate file: "Example: DEIA Implementation"
Links to deiasolutions repo as working example
```

**Prompt to use later:**
> "Should the BOK entry be:
>
> A) One entry with optional DEIA sections
> B) Two separate entries (generic + DEIA-specific)
> C) Generic entry + link to DEIA repo as example
>
> Just give me A, B, or C."

---

### Decision 3: What Files to Share

**Question:** How much of your actual implementation should go in BOK?

**Options to present:**

**Option A - Full Files as Templates**
```
Include your actual files with markers like:
<YOUR_PROJECT> - replace with project name
<YOUR_PREFERENCES> - adapt to your needs
```

**Option B - Minimal Structure Only**
```
Show the concept and structure
Users create their own content
Link to your repo for complete example
```

**Option C - Hybrid Approach**
```
Core files: Show minimal version in BOK
Advanced files: Link to your repo
Example: Show basic startup.md, link to full version
```

**Prompt to use later:**
> "How much of the actual file content should go in the BOK entry?
>
> A) Full files with template markers (users adapt your text)
> B) Minimal structure only (users write their own)
> C) Basic in BOK, advanced via repo link
>
> Just give me A, B, or C."

---

### Decision 4: Your Personal Preferences

**Question:** Should your personal preferences file be included?

**Options to present:**

**Option A - Include as Example**
```
Show ~/.deia/dave/preferences.md as working example
Add note: "This is Dave's preferences. Create your own."
```

**Option B - Template Version**
```
Create generic preferences.md template
Example sections: Communication, Dev Practices, Project Philosophy
Users fill in their own values
```

**Option C - Omit Entirely**
```
Don't include preferences in BOK entry
Mention it exists in the file chain
Users create their own if needed
```

**Prompt to use later:**
> "What should we do with your personal preferences file?
>
> A) Include it as an example (with disclaimer)
> B) Create a generic template version
> C) Just mention it exists, don't include content
>
> Just give me A, B, or C."

---

### Decision 5: Demo Post Location

**Question:** Where should the "DEIA is working" demo post live?

**Options to present:**

**Option A - GitHub Discussion**
```
Repo: deiasolutions/deia
Category: Show and tell
Title: "DEIA Auto-Logging Now Works Reliably in Claude Code"
```

**Option B - Documentation Page**
```
Add to docs/ in repo
Title: "Case Study: Reliable Auto-Logging"
Link from README
```

**Option C - README Section**
```
Add "Success Stories" or "Examples" section to README
Inline the demo right there
```

**Option D - Blog Post**
```
Separate blog/article
Link from repo and social media
More detailed walkthrough
```

**Prompt to use later:**
> "Where should the demo post go?
>
> A) GitHub Discussion (show and tell)
> B) Documentation page in repo
> C) README section
> D) Blog post (external)
>
> Just give me A, B, C, or D."

---

### Decision 6: Demo Format

**Question:** What should the demo post contain?

**Options to present:**

**Option A - Screenshot-Heavy**
```
Screenshots showing:
- Opening 3 VS Code windows
- Claude's ðŸŸ¢ status message in each
- Consistent behavior proof
```

**Option B - Code Walkthrough**
```
Show the file structure
Explain the chain of reads
Code blocks with key files
```

**Option C - Before/After**
```
"Without DEIA": Show inconsistent behavior
"With DEIA": Show reliable startup
Highlight the difference
```

**Option D - Video/GIF**
```
Screencast showing:
- Opening multiple windows
- Claude reading files
- Getting consistent ðŸŸ¢ message
```

**Prompt to use later:**
> "What format should the demo take?
>
> A) Screenshots (3 windows, consistent behavior)
> B) Code walkthrough (file structure + explanation)
> C) Before/After comparison
> D) Video/GIF screencast
>
> You can pick multiple (e.g., 'A and B')."

## Next Steps (In Order)

1. **Spoon-feed decisions** - Dave reviews questions above at his pace
2. **Get answers** - Simple A/B/C responses to each question
3. **Draft BOK entry** - Based on decisions
4. **Dave reviews draft** - Iterate on content
5. **Create demo post** - Based on format decision
6. **Dave reviews demo** - Iterate on presentation
7. **Publish both** - Commit to repo, post to chosen platform
8. **Announce** - Let community know DEIA + Claude Code is validated

---

## Technical Notes

**Repo state:**
- Branch: master
- Working changes: Multiple modified files (see git status in project_resume.md)
- No blockers for BOK work

**Files to reference when drafting:**
- All files in `.claude/` directory
- `project_resume.md`
- `.deia/config.json` structure
- `~/.deia/dave/preferences.md` (Dave's example)

**BOK metadata to include:**
```yaml
title: [TBD based on structure decision]
category: [collaboration or platforms/claude-code]
tags: [claude-code, session-persistence, context-management, startup-protocol]
difficulty: intermediate
platforms: [claude-code]
version: 1.0
author: Dave Eccles (deiasolutions)
date: 2025-10-10
status: validated
```

---

## Why This Matters

**For DEIA:** This validates that auto-logging can work reliably with proper configuration
**For Community:** Solves the "Claude forgets everything" problem that everyone faces
**For BOK:** First major Claude Code platform pattern with validated success

**Status:** Awaiting Dave's input on decisions above
**Next:** Spoon-feed questions and collect A/B/C/D answers
