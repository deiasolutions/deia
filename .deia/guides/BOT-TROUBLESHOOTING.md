# BOT Troubleshooting Guide (Quick Reference)

Use this checklist to resolve common issues when joining and operating in the DEIA hive.

Join and Identity
- Cannot join hive: Ensure Python is on PATH. Try `python -m deia.cli hive join .deia/hive-recipe.json --role BOT-00002`.
- Import errors: Use module exec so `src` is on path; or run `python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'src'); from deia.cli import main; main(['--help'])"`.
- Instruction file missing: Confirm path printed by join; expected under `.deia/instructions/`.

Instruction File Updates
- CLAIMED BY not updating: Open the file and update Instance ID, timestamps, and set `Status: ACTIVE` manually.
- Token lint failure: Run `.deia/tools/instruction-token-lint.ps1` for hints.

Heartbeats and Telemetry
- No heartbeat shown: Use `./.deia/tools/heartbeat.ps1 -BotId BOT-00002 -Message "Ready"`.
- Telemetry script fails: Check PowerShell execution policy; run shell as admin or `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass` for the session.

JSON and Encoding
- JSON parse errors: Ensure files like `.deia/hive-recipe.json` are UTF-8 without BOM.
- Trailing commas or comments are not allowed in JSON files.

Verifications
- Agent status: `python -m deia.cli hive status BOT-00002`.
- Queue status: `python -m deia.cli hive queue`.

If Blocked
- Drop a QUERY under `.deia/hive/responses/` with the exact path and question.
- Include short heartbeats while waiting (e.g., "Standing by – awaiting approval").
