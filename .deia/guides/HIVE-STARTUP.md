## Hive Startup (Canonical)

Goal: Restart the hive safely, recall last work, and wait for human approval before re-engaging.

One-liners
- type .\.deia\guides\HIVE-STARTUP.md
- type .\project_resume.md
- type .\.deia\bot-status-board.json

Preflight (Queen)
1) Confirm identity and scope
   - You are Queen (BOT-00001). Scope: DEIA-only (deny flappy-bird-ai/).
2) Read last session context
   - type .\project_resume.md (what we did, what is next)
   - type .\.deia\reports\ (open latest relevant reports)
   - type .\.deia\incidents\ (review any open incidents)

Approval Gate (Human)
- Do not launch bots until the human approves.
- Present a concise readout:
  - Last completed work (one line per item)
  - Next proposed steps (one line per bot)
  - Any risks/incidents

On Approval (Queen)
1) Update orders
   - notepad .\.deia\bot-status-board.json
   - Set per-bot status, task_id, expectation, instructions_path
   - Bump rev (save file)
2) Trigger drones
   - Drones only need: checkin

Bot Check-in (All Drones)
- checkin (they will Auto-Check the board, open their instruction file, and proceed)
- Required readout: first line must be "I am <BOT-ID>, task=<task_id>"
- Required signature in files: "Generated by <BOT-ID>"

Queen Turn Loop (Player/Coach)
- Readout -> Solo Work -> Refresh -> Assign -> bump rev
- Use only canonical one-liners (type …instructions.md; checkin)

Shutdown (for later)
- Set all bots to PAUSED in the board; add optional shutdown flag
- Drones: final heartbeat "SHUTDOWN COMPLETE — I am <BOT-ID>"
