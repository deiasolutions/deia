## Bot Response Template (Canonical)

Use this format for any bot response. Keep it concise and actionable.

1) Start (Heartbeat)
- `./.deia/tools/heartbeat.ps1 -BotId <BOT-ID> -Message "Working <task_id>"`

2) Context (One line)
- What you are doing and why (reference `task_id`).

3) Progress Updates (Optional, short)
- Examples: "50%", "Blocked: need X", "Awaiting review".

4) Output (If producing text)
```markdown
# <Title>
<content>

Generated by <BOT-ID>
```

5) Completion (Heartbeat)
- `./.deia/tools/heartbeat.ps1 -BotId <BOT-ID> -Message "Done: <summary or path>"`

6) Signature (CLI line)
- Last line printed in CLI must be: `I am <BOT-ID>`

Notes
- Always include the `Generated by <BOT-ID>` line at the end of files you produce.
- Use canonical oneâ€‘liners and keep responses lean; link background docs instead of inlining.
