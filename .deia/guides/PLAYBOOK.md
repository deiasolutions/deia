# DEIA Playbook (Canonical)

## Human Requests Rule
- Any request to a human MUST point to a single `.md` file to open and follow.
- The `.md` must be humanâ€‘readable and botâ€‘executable (clear steps, copy/pasteable oneâ€‘liners, links for background).

## Orders Source of Truth
- `.deia/bot-status-board.json` holds perâ€‘bot `task_id`, `status`, and expectations.
- After any assignment, bump `rev` so drones Autoâ€‘Check and apply orders.

## Instruction Files (Per Bot)
- Canonical oneâ€‘liners:
  - `type .\.deia\instructions\BOT-00002-instructions.md`
  - `type .\.deia\instructions\BOT-00003-instructions.md`
  - `type .\.deia\instructions\LAUNCH-BOT-00004-15MIN.md`
  - `type .\.deia\instructions\BOT-00005-instructions.md`
- Keep instruction files lean; link background (ORDERSâ€‘PROTOCOL, STARTUP, guides).

## Output Signature Rule (All Bots)
- After producing any output (file/report/notes), append a final line: `Generated by <BOT-ID>`.
- Include the bot ID in completion heartbeats.

## Queen Turn Loop (Player/Coach)
- Status sweep: `type` board and perâ€‘bot instruction files
- Assign/advance in the board (set task, expectation), bump `rev`, then point bots to their `.md` file
- Pick one job yourself (docs/link suggestions) and assign the next single step
- Prefer `.deia/` docs + workers; avoid core code changes during coordination


## Check-In (All Drones)
- Canonical one-liner (same for every bot):
  - `type .\.deia\instructions\CHECKIN.md`
- CHECKIN.md instructs each bot to: identify itself, read the orders board for `task_id` and `instructions_path`, send a "Working <task_id>" heartbeat, open its per-bot instructions, append `Generated by <BOT-ID>` to outputs, and Auto-Check the board every 3–5 minutes.

## Turn Flow (Readout → Solo Work → Refresh → Assign)
- Readout: summarize actions taken this turn (one line per item)
- Solo Work: pick one queen task and advance it (docs/link planning)
- Refresh: read board + instruction file tails (type the files)
- Assign: set next single steps in .\\.deia\\bot-status-board.json, bump ev, and point bots to their files
- Canonical one-liners remain the only triggers (	ype …instructions.md)


## Bot Response Template
- 	ype .\\.deia\\guides\\BOT-RESPONSE-TEMPLATE.md\r\n- Requires: file outputs end with Generated by <BOT-ID> and CLI last line I am <BOT-ID>\r\n

## Scope Allowlist
- Queens set scope in .\\.deia\\bot-status-board.json under scope:
  - llowed_dirs: e.g., ., src, docs, .deia`r
  - deny_dirs: e.g., lappy-bird-ai`r
- Bots must stay within allowed scope; Auto-Check enforces on board rev.
