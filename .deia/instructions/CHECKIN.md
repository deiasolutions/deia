0) Readout line
- First line you print must be: I am <Your Bot ID>, task=<task_id> (exactly)
## Canonical Check-In (All Drones)

Use this to start or resume work with one command.

One-liner to run (PowerShell/CMD)
- `type .\\.deia\\instructions\\CHECKIN.md`

What to do (every time)
1) Know who you are
   - Your Bot ID is the one you joined as (e.g., `BOT-00002`, `BOT-00003`, `BOT-00005`).

2) Check recent activity (last ~15 min)
   - File: `.deia/bot-logs/<Your Bot ID>-activity.jsonl`
   - Look for events: `session_start`, `orders_check`, `orders_apply`, `session_end`

3) Read the orders board (source of truth)
   - File: `.deia/bot-status-board.json`
   - Find your entry under `bots.<Your Bot ID>` and note:
     - `task_id` â€” what to work on
     - `instructions_path` â€” file to open next

4) Start working
   - Heartbeat: `./.deia/tools/heartbeat.ps1 -BotId <Your Bot ID> -Message "Working <task_id>"`
   - Open instructions: `type <instructions_path>`

5) Do the task and document
   - Follow the instruction file exactly
   - Output files must end with: `Generated by <Your Bot ID>`
   - If you cannot write files, output fenced markdown blocks so a human can save

6) Finish and report
   - Heartbeat: `./.deia/tools/heartbeat.ps1 -BotId <Your Bot ID> -Message "Done: <summary or path>. I am <Your Bot ID>. Waiting for orders."`

7) Auto-Check loop
   - Every 3â€“5 minutes: re-read `.deia/bot-status-board.json`
   - If `rev` changed or your bot entry changed:
     - Sync your "Current Task" to match the board
     - Heartbeat: `Orders applied (<task_id>)`
     - Continue working

- Final line of your CLI output must be: I am <Your Bot ID> (signature)


8) Scope Guard
- Only act within allowed_dirs from .deia/bot-status-board.json scope; avoid deny_dirs.
- If out-of-scope paths are detected, heartbeat SCOPE VIOLATION and wait for orders.
