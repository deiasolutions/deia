```

**Repeat for all 11 files.**

### Section 4: Test Coverage Analysis (2 pages)

**Overall Coverage:**
- Total LOC: X
- Covered LOC: Y
- Coverage: Z%
- Target for 1.0: >80%

**Files Below Target (<80%):**
| File | Coverage | Missing | Priority |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| bot_queue.py | 65% | Error paths | High |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Test Quality:**
- Unit tests: X (good/poor separation?)
- Integration tests: Y (present/absent?)
- Mock strategy: Appropriate/overused/underused?
- Edge cases: Well covered/gaps?

**Recommendations:**
1. Add tests for X
2. Improve coverage on Y
3. Consider integration tests for Z

### Section 5: Technical Debt Register (2 pages)

**Priority 1: MUST FIX for 1.0**
| Issue | File | Line | Description | Effort |
|-------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| Hard-coded path | hive.py | 127 | Uses `~/.deia/` directly | 30 min |
| Missing validation | hive.py | 203 | No check for malformed JSON | 1 hour |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Priority 2: Should Fix for 1.0**
| Issue | File | Line | Description | Effort |
|-------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| Long method | hive.py | 150-220 | launch_hive is 70 lines | 2 hours |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Priority 3: Nice-to-Have (defer to 1.1)**
| Issue | File | Line | Description | Effort |
|-------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| Refactor | cli.py | ... | Command help text verbose | 1 hour |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Total Effort:**
- P1 (must fix): X hours

### Section 6: Feature Completeness (2 pages)

**Spec vs Implementation:**

Compare what was specified vs what exists:

| Hive launch | Yes | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ 100% |
| Bot queue | Yes (BACKLOG-XXX) | Yes | Partial | ‚ö†Ô∏è 80% |
| Cost routing | Yes | Partial | No | ‚ùå 40% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Gaps:**
1. **Cost-aware routing** - Specified in Carbon Economy proposal, partially implemented
2. **Service delegation** - Not yet implemented
3. **Metrics tracking** - Missing (needed for Project Eggs)

**Missing Features Critical for 1.0:**

### Section 8: Critical Path to 1.0 (2 pages)

**MUST COMPLETE for 1.0:**
1. Fix all P1 technical debt (X hours)
2. Implement missing feature Y (Y hours)
3. Achieve 80% test coverage (Z hours)
4. Address security concern W (W hours)

**Total effort: X hours = Y weeks**

- If P1 tasks > 80 hours: ‚ùå NO-GO (need 1.0.1 or more time)

### Section 9: Recommendations (1 page)

**Your expert opinion:**
- Is the codebase 1.0-ready?
- What are the top 3 priorities?
