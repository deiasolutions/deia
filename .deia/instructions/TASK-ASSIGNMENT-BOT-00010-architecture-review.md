# TASK ASSIGNMENT: BOT-00010 (Architecture & Infrastructure Review)

**From:** BOT-00001 (Queen)
**To:** BOT-00010
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Mission:** Path to DEIA 1.0 - Architecture & Infrastructure Review
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Deadline:** 2025-10-14 14:00 (Phase 1)

---

## Your Mission

You are the **architecture evaluator**. Review DEIA's architectural decisions, infrastructure, and system design.

**Scope:** Split from BOT-08's code review - focus on ARCHITECTURE, not implementation details

**Deliverable:** `.deia/reports/BOT-00010-architecture-review-1.0-path.md`

---

## Files to Review

### Architecture & Design Documents
- `.deia/hive-coordination-rules.md`
- `.deia/decisions/QUEEN-DECREE-20251012-immune-system.md`
- `.deia/decisions/QUEEN-DECREE-20251012-carbon-economy.md`
- `.deia/reports/BOT-00008-immune-system-proposal.md`
- `.deia/QUEEN-WORKPLAN-distributed-carbon-economy.md`
- `docs/architecture/` directory (if exists)

### Infrastructure Code (System Design Focus)
- `src/deia/hive.py` - Hive architecture
- `src/deia/bot_queue.py` - Bot coordination system
- `~/.deia/bot_coordinator.py` - Bot registry
- `~/.deia/task_service.py` - Task service (if exists)

### Configuration & Setup
- `.deia/config.json`
- `.deia/hive-recipe.json`
- `.deia/backlog.json`
- `pyproject.toml`

---

## Review Focus

### 1. **System Architecture**
- Is the hive model sound?
- Bot coordination scalable?
- Clear separation of concerns?
- Bottlenecks identified?

### 2. **Infrastructure Design**
- File-based coordination viable?
- Task queue architecture robust?
- State management approach?
- Failure recovery mechanisms?

### 3. **Scalability Assessment**
- Can this handle 10 bots? 100 bots?
- File contention issues?
- Performance bottlenecks?
- Resource requirements?

### 4. **Security & Safety**
- Immune system proposal feasibility?
- Security boundaries clear?
- Data privacy protected?
- Access control mechanisms?

### 5. **Integration Points**
- How do components connect?
- APIs well-defined?
- Extension points clear?
- Coupling vs cohesion?

---

## Required Report Sections

### 1. Architecture Overview
Current system design with diagrams (ASCII art fine)

### 2. Component Analysis
Each major component assessed:
- Purpose
- Design quality
- Integration points
- Strengths/weaknesses

### 3. Scalability Analysis
- Current limits
- Growth path
- Bottlenecks
- Recommendations

### 4. Infrastructure SWOT
**Strengths:** What's architecturally sound?
**Weaknesses:** Design flaws, technical debt?
**Opportunities:** Improvements, optimizations?
**Threats:** Scaling risks, security concerns?

### 5. Proposal Evaluation
**Immune System:** Feasibility assessment
**Carbon Economy:** Resource impact analysis
**Recommendations:** Go/defer/modify for 1.0

### 6. Critical Architecture Issues for 1.0
**Blockers:** Must-fix architectural issues
**Important:** Should-fix for 1.0
**Future:** Can defer to post-1.0

## Coordination

Update `.deia/bot-status-board.json` daily with progress.

If blocked: Create `.deia/instructions/ESCALATION-BOT-00010.md`

Collaborate with BOT-08: `.deia/reports/BOT-10-to-BOT-08-{topic}.md`

## Timeline

**Phase 1 (48 hours):** Complete architecture review
**Deadline:** 2025-10-14 14:00
