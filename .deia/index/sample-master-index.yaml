notes: |
  This is a SAMPLE index showing proposed structure.

  AWAITING:
  - Taxonomy from GPT-5 (Bot D) for final cluster organization
  - May refine cluster names/groupings based on taxonomy
  - May add additional cross-references
  - Will add more query patterns as usage patterns emerge

  NEXT STEPS:
  1. Receive GPT-5 taxonomy
  2. Refine cluster organization
  3. Implement query interface
  4. Build Master Librarian service
  5. Start logging queries for analytics
