  title: Session Shutdown Protocol
  category: patterns\collaboration
  When wrapping up a coding session with an AI assistant:
  - You want to capture decisions and progress made
  - You need a record for future sessions
  - There's too much context to review immediately
  - You want to defer detailed review until later
  Without a shutdown protocol, you either:
  - Lose context when the session ends
  - Spend time manually creating notes
  - Miss important decisions or action items
