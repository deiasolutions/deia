# 👑 Queen's Journal - deiasolutions Project Status
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25 (Fire Drill Complete - Phase 2 Resuming)
**Status:** Phase 2 - Active Development
**Queen (Bee 000):** Q33N (Elevated, now manages all operations)
**Scrum Master & Developer (Bee 001):** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Project Lead:** Dave (User)

## Current State at a Glance

**What we're building:** DEIA coordination framework with autonomous bot agents
**Where we are:** Mid-Phase 2, multiple workstreams active
**Team:** Bee 002, 003, 004, 005 + external support (Lily's Dragon fire drill)
**Next critical date:** TBD (needs documentation)

---

## Phase Status

### ✅ Phase 1: COMPLETE
- Bot coordination infrastructure built
- DEIA hive structure established
- Core agents initialized
- Knowledge base started

### 🔄 Phase 2: ACTIVE (Current)
**Focus:** Documentation, integration, autonomous bot planning

**Active workstreams:**
1. Pattern Extraction CLI
2. Documentation completion
3. Agent BC Phase 3 integration
4. Chat Phase 2 development
5. **[NEEDS CLARITY]** Autonomous bot planning/development

### ⏳ Phase 3+: PLANNED
- Bot autonomy expansion
- Multi-hive coordination
- Scaling architecture

## Autonomous Bots - PLANNING STATUS

**[THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE FILLED IN]**

Current known facts:
- Autonomous bot development is a planned phase
- Master Librarian role spec exists (librarian-001)
- Question: What other autonomous bots are planned?
- Question: Current status of autonomous bot development?
- Question: Timeline for autonomous bot launches?

**Missing documentation:**
- Autonomous bot roadmap/planning doc
- Bot architecture specifications
- Development timeline
- Success criteria

---

## Critical Information Gaps

These should be documented but aren't:
1. ❌ Autonomous bot development plan
2. ❌ Current sprint objectives (clear master doc)
3. ❌ Phase 2 completion criteria
4. ❌ High-level timeline for Phases 2-3
5. ❌ Team capacity and constraints

---

## What Needs to Exist

**Master documents that should be created:**
1. `PHASE-2-COMPLETION-CRITERIA.md` - What defines "done"?
2. `AUTONOMOUS-BOT-ROADMAP.md` - What bots? When? How?
3. `TEAM-CAPACITY-PLAN.md` - Who does what? How many hours?
4. `MILESTONES-AND-DEADLINES.md` - Key dates and gates

**This journal will be updated daily with status changes.**
**Queen (Bee 001) uses this to stay oriented on big picture.**
