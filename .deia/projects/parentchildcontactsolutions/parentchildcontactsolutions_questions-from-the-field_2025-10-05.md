# Questions from the Field - FamilyBondBot Session

**Project:** Family Bond Bot (parentchildcontactsolutions)
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Session:** HTTPS Fix & Constitution Creation
**Status:** Open questions for Dave to answer

---

## Purpose

These questions emerged during the FamilyBondBot debugging session. They're being routed to the DEIA Solutions chat for Dave to answer there, keeping the FamilyBondBot session focused on technical implementation.

## Questions for DEIA Solutions Constitution Development

### Question 1: What are your "production" equivalents?

**Context:** FamilyBondBot has clear production deployment boundaries (vercel --prod, railway deploy). DEIA Solutions needs to define what constitutes "production" in your knowledge work environment.

**Question:**
What operations in DEIA Solutions should be treated like "production deployments" and require explicit human approval?

**Examples to consider:**
- Publishing blog posts or articles?
- Deploying documentation to public sites?
- Updating the Book of Knowledge (BOK) structure?
- Modifying client-facing content?
- Changing brand voice/tone guidelines?
- Updating training materials?
- Something else entirely?

**Why this matters:**
The Constitution needs to define clear boundaries. If we don't know what "production" means for DEIA, we can't protect it properly.

---

### Question 2: What other boundaries need biometric protection?

**Context:** FamilyBondBot now requires biometric verification (photo/video/voice) to modify the CONSTITUTION.md. This is the "nuclear codes" protocol to prevent social engineering.

**Question:**
Beyond constitutional changes, what other operations in DEIA Solutions are so critical they should require biometric verification?

**Examples to consider:**
- Modifying client data or case files?
- Changing BOK (Book of Knowledge) organizational structure?
- Altering brand identity or positioning documents?
- Modifying financial or billing information?
- Deleting or archiving large bodies of work?
- Changing access control or permissions?

**Why this matters:**
Biometric protection is expensive (human friction). We should reserve it for truly critical operations that could cause irreversible harm if socially engineered.

### Question 3: Are there DEIA-specific rules needed?

**Context:** FamilyBondBot has technical rules (imports, deployments, testing). DEIA Solutions likely needs rules specific to your domain.

**Question:**
What rules should be in the DEIA Solutions constitution that are specific to your work in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility?

**Examples to consider:**

**Tone & Language:**
- Rules about using inclusive language?
- Guidelines for discussing sensitive topics?
- Requirements for person-first vs identity-first language?
- Avoiding stereotypes or assumptions?

**Representation:**
- Requirements to consider multiple perspectives?
- Rules about representing diverse voices?
- Guidelines for avoiding single-story narratives?

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Rules about researching cultural context before writing?
- Requirements to cite diverse sources?
- Guidelines for avoiding cultural appropriation?

**Client Confidentiality:**
- Rules about handling sensitive client information?
- Guidelines for anonymizing case studies?
- Requirements for client approval before sharing examples?

**Accessibility:**
- Rules about creating accessible content (alt text, captions, etc.)?
- Requirements for plain language in public-facing content?
- Guidelines for universal design principles?

**Why this matters:**
DEIA work has unique ethical considerations. The constitution should codify your values and prevent AI from making choices that violate DEIA principles.

### Question 4: What are the collaboration patterns between human and AI in DEIA work?

**Context:** FamilyBondBot constitution defines clear human vs AI roles (human: strategy, AI: implementation). What does this look like for DEIA Solutions?

**Question:**
In DEIA work, where should AI make autonomous decisions vs ask for human guidance?

**Examples to consider:**

**AI should probably make autonomous decisions about:**
- ? Grammar and formatting
- ? Research and citation gathering
- ? Organizing information logically
- ? Creating draft outlines
- ? Suggesting alternative phrasings

**AI should probably ask human for guidance about:**
- ? Tone when discussing sensitive topics
- ? Which perspectives to prioritize
- ? Cultural nuances and context
- ? Client-specific approaches
- ? Final framing of key messages

**Why this matters:**
Different domains have different risk profiles. DEIA work involves ethical considerations that technical work doesn't. The constitution should make these boundaries explicit.

---

### Question 5: How should errors be handled in DEIA work?

**Context:** FamilyBondBot has technical error recovery (fix immediately, test, document). DEIA errors might require different handling.

**Question:**
If AI makes a mistake in DEIA work (uses insensitive language, presents biased information, etc.), what should the error recovery process be?

**Should it be:**
- Immediate correction + explanation of why it was wrong?
- Flag for human review before correction?
- Document in a learning log for pattern analysis?
- Something else?

**Why this matters:**
DEIA mistakes can cause harm beyond "the system broke." The constitution should define how to handle errors with appropriate sensitivity.

---

## Meta-Question: Constitution Scope

**Question:**
Should DEIA Solutions have ONE constitution for all AI work, or separate constitutions for different types of work (client projects, internal knowledge work, public content, etc.)?

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Single constitution:** Simpler, consistent, easier to maintain
- **Multiple constitutions:** More precise boundaries, different risk profiles acknowledged

**Why this matters:**
This decision affects how we structure governance going forward.

---

## Implementation Questions

### Question A: Who should enforce the constitution?

**Options:**
1. AI self-enforces by reading it each session
2. Human spot-checks and calls out violations
3. Automated checks where possible (git hooks, linters, etc.)
4. All of the above

### Question B: How should constitutional violations be tracked?

**Should we:**
- Create a VIOLATIONS.md log?
- Add to session logs?
- Track patterns over time?
- Use it to improve the constitution?

### Question C: How often should the constitution be reviewed?

**Options:**
- After every violation
- Monthly review
- Quarterly review
- Ad-hoc when patterns emerge
- Other cadence

## Instructions for DEIA Solutions Claude

When Dave brings these questions to you:

1. **Don't dump all questions at once** - Work through them conversationally
2. **Start with Question 1** (production equivalents) - It's foundational
3. **Use examples** - Help Dave think through concrete scenarios
4. **Iterate on answers** - First draft doesn't need to be perfect
5. **Document decisions** - Capture the reasoning, not just the rule
6. **Link back to FamilyBondBot learnings** - Reference the session log for context
