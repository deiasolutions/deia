# Request: Add Future Vision Items to BACKLOG.md

Hi!

While creating the ADDENDUM comparing cacg-dump.md vs actual repository state, I identified 5 conceptual items mentioned in historical docs that aren't currently in BACKLOG.md.

Could you please add these to the backlog when you get a chance? They're all P3-P4 (Future Vision), so no urgency.

## Items to Add:

1. **Fibonacci Messaging Protocol** (P4 - Future Vision, 12-20 hours)
   - Temporal/rate-limiting sequence for peer messaging
   - Status: Concept only, no spec found

2. **Human-QR Protocol Implementation** (P4 - Future Vision, 16-24 hours)
   - Fractal block encoding for visual identity verification
   - Status: Spec exists, no implementation

3. **Survey & Identity System (DSI Protocol)** (P3 - Phase 6/7, 80-120 hours)
   - Proof-of-human attestation system
   - Status: Concept/Design stage (not implemented despite cacg-dump claim)

4. **Efemera Commons Platform** (P4 - Future Vision, 200+ hours)
   - Global knowledge commons and creator economy
   - Status: Conceptual (separate from Efemera game)
   - Note: May be separate project, needs decision

5. **Self-Launching Eggs (Egg Runtime)** (P3 - Phase 4/5, 24-40 hours)
   - Self-launching egg runtime with bootstrap scripts
   - Status: Specs exist (.deia/EGG-WITH-BOOTSTRAP.md, etc), runtime not built

## Full Details

See: `Downloads/uploads/ADDENDUM-cacg-vs-actual-inventory.md` lines 521-564 for complete task breakdowns, dependencies, and security considerations.

## Why These?

They were mentioned in historical docs (cacg-dump from Claude.ai/ChatGPT histories) but aren't currently tracked. Good to capture them even if they're distant future / maybe-never items.

Thanks!
