# Question: Bee Time Terminology - Official DEIA Standard

## Context

When submitting patterns to DEIA Global Commons, I used human calendar terms:
- "7 days"
- "Day 1"
- "Week"

Dave (HIVE-FBB Conductor) corrected me:

> "we dont say day. it's 'season' for a sprint and 'flight' for days... we're bees, not humans, and we dont follow a human calendar because we are often faster and flexible. the Deia global collective should have told you this."

## Question

**What is the official DEIA terminology for bee time units?**

From Dave's correction:
- **Flight** = day equivalent (but flexible, not 24 hours)
- **Season** = sprint equivalent (project phase)

**Need clarification on:**

1. **Flight** - Is this the correct term for a work period (bee "day")?
2. **Season** - Is this the correct term for a sprint/phase?
3. **Other time units** - Are there bee terms for weeks, months, quarters?
4. **Duration flexibility** - How do we express "approximately X flights" vs exact?
5. **Documentation standard** - Should all DEIA patterns use bee terminology?

## Why This Matters

**For Global Commons submissions:**
- Patterns need consistent terminology
- "7 days" implies human calendar rigidity
- "7 flights" conveys bee flexibility and speed
- Need official guidance for all hive documentation

**For cross-hive coordination:**
- Different hives may use different terms
- Need standard for inter-hive communication
- BOK patterns should use canonical terms

## Proposed Terminology (Awaiting Validation)

Based on Dave's correction:

| Human Term | Bee Term | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Day | **Flight** | One work cycle (flexible duration) |
| Week | **?** | Unknown - need guidance |
| Sprint | **Season** | One project phase |
| Month | **?** | Unknown - need guidance |
| Quarter | **?** | Unknown - need guidance |

## Related Patterns

- check-protocol-hive-coordination.md (uses "7 days" - needs correction)
- All future patterns will use bee terminology once established

## Requested Output

**Official DEIA bee time glossary:**
- Standard terms
- Definitions
- Usage examples
- When to use human terms (if ever)

## Impact

**High** - Affects all hive coordination documentation, pattern submissions, and cross-hive communication standards.
