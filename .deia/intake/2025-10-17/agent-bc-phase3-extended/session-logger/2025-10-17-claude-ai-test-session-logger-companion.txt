This code companion provides an overview of the test suite for the Session Logger component.

The test suite covers the main functionality of the Session Logger, including:
1. Logging task start and complete events
2. Logging file read and write events
3. Logging tool call events
4. Generating session summaries
5. Saving session logs to a file
6. Analyzing a session from a saved log file

The test suite uses pytest fixtures to create instances of the SessionLogger class and generate sample session log files for testing purposes.

Each test case focuses on a specific method or functionality of the Session Logger, verifying the expected behavior by making assertions on the logged events, session summaries, and analysis results.

To run the test suite, ensure that pytest is installed and run the following command:
```
pytest test_session_logger_v2.txt
```

The test suite assumes the existence of the SessionLogger class and its associated classes (TaskEvent, FileEvent, ToolEvent, SessionSummary) in the same directory.

For more details on the implementation and usage of the Session Logger component, please refer to the main code file and the associated documentation.
