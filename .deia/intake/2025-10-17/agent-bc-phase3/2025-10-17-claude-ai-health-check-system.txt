Task 18: Health Check System
Agent: CLAUDE_AI (Agent BC)

Requirements:
- Comprehensive system health checks
- Agent status, messaging, BOK index, filesystem, dependencies
- CLI: `deia health`
- Auto-fix common issues

Value: System diagnostics and troubleshooting

Implementation Details:
- Create a `HealthCheckSystem` class that performs various health checks
- Implement the following health checks:
  - Agent status: Check if all registered agents are responsive and their heartbeats are up to date
  - Messaging system: Verify that the messaging system is functioning correctly by sending and receiving test messages
  - BOK index: Validate the integrity of the BOK index, checking for missing or corrupted entries
  - Filesystem: Check the DEIA project filesystem for any missing or inaccessible directories and files
  - Dependencies: Verify that all required dependencies are installed and up to date
- Each health check should return a status (pass/fail) and a detailed message
- Implement a CLI command `deia health` that runs all the health checks and displays the results
- For common issues detected by the health checks, implement auto-fix functionality to attempt to resolve them automatically
- Provide a detailed health report that includes the status of each health check, any issues found, and the steps taken to auto-fix them

Usage:
- Run all health checks:
  $ deia health

- Run specific health checks:
  $ deia health --agents --messaging --bok --fs --deps

- Auto-fix common issues:
  $ deia health --auto-fix

Integration:
- The health check system should be integrated into the DEIA CLI as a top-level command
- The health checks should be runnable on-demand or as part of a scheduled maintenance task
- The health check results should be logged and stored for historical analysis and troubleshooting

Dependencies:
- DEIA CLI
- Agent status tracker
- Messaging system
- BOK management system
- Filesystem access

Testing:
- Unit tests for each health check
- Integration tests with the various DEIA subsystems
- End-to-end tests simulating common failure scenarios and verifying auto-fix functionality

Deliverables:
- health_check_system.py: The main implementation of the health check system
- health_check_cli.py: Integration of the health check system with the DEIA CLI
- health_check_auto_fix.py: Auto-fix functionality for common issues
- health_check_report.py: Generation of detailed health reports
- test_health_check_system.py: Unit and integration tests for the health check system
- health_check_system_docs.md: Documentation and usage guide for the health check system
