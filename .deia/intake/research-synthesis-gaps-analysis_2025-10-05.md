# Research Synthesis: What We're Missing & What We Can Use

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of existing knowledge commons, standards bodies, licensing models, and failures
**Status:** Critical gaps identified, freely usable frameworks found

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What exists:** Scientific knowledge sharing (arXiv, protocols.io), commons governance (Ostrom), licensing models (CC, GPL)

**What doesn't exist:** Privacy-preserving human-AI collaboration pattern repository across all domains

**DEIA is novel.** But we're missing critical infrastructure pieces.

---

## PART 1: FREELY USABLE FRAMEWORKS (We Can Adopt These)

### 1. Elinor Ostrom's 8 Principles for Commons Governance 🏆

**Source:** Nobel Prize-winning research (2009), published "Understanding Knowledge as a Commons" (MIT Press, 2007)
**Status:** Public domain research, freely adaptable
**Why this matters:** She studied 800+ commons cases and wrote THE BOOK on knowledge commons

**The 8 Principles:**
1. **Clearly defined boundaries** - Who has rights to contribute/access
2. **Congruence with local conditions** - No one-size-fits-all (domain-specific rules)
3. **Participatory decision-making** - Contributors write the rules
4. **Monitoring** - Community-based oversight
5. **Graduated sanctions** - Warnings → fines → expulsion
6. **Conflict resolution** - Accessible, informal, affordable
7. **Nested governance levels** - Domain → BOK → Foundation → Board
8. **External recognition** - Government/institutions recognize our rights

**WE HAVEN'T DESIGNED DEIA AGAINST THESE YET.**

**Action needed:** Map DEIA Constitution to Ostrom's 8 principles, identify gaps

---

### 2. FAIR Principles (Scientific Data Standard)

**Source:** Nature Scientific Data (2016), NIH **mandatory** since 2023
**Status:** Open standard, freely adoptable
**Acronym:** Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable

**Key insight:** "Data can be restricted AND still be FAIR"

**Application to DEIA:**
- **Findable:** BOK entries have metadata, searchable by domain/pattern/platform
- **Accessible:** Clear protocols for access (public BOK vs private IP)
- **Interoperable:** Standard formats (YAML frontmatter + Markdown, JSON metadata)
- **Reusable:** Well-described with licensing, provenance, context

**WE SHOULD MAKE BOK FAIR-COMPLIANT.**

**Action needed:** Create FAIR compliance checklist for BOK entries

---

### 3. arXiv Model (Preprint Repository)

**Source:** Cornell University (1991), 2+ million papers
**Status:** Well-documented, reproducible model
**Key features:**

**Endorsement System:**
- New authors need endorsement from established arXiv author
- Prevents spam without gatekeeping
- Builds trust network
- **We don't have this**

**Version Control:**
- Can update papers after publication
- Each version is preserved with timestamp
- DOI remains stable, points to latest
- **We mentioned this but didn't spec it**

**Moderation:**
- Subject-area moderators (domain experts)
- Check relevance, not quality (let readers judge)
- Rapid posting (24-48 hours)

**Success metric:** 90% of physics papers go to arXiv BEFORE journal publication

**Application to DEIA:** Endorsement prevents spam, version control allows improvement

---

### 4. Protocols.io Model (Scientific Methods Sharing)

**Source:** protocols.io platform, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative funded
**Status:** Proven model, freely replicable
**Key features:**

**Privacy-First Workflow:**
- **Private by default** - new protocols are private to creator
- Share when ready (selected people OR public)
- **THIS IS WHAT DEIA NEEDS**

**Version Control + Immutability:**
- Once published, **cannot edit** (prevents revisionist history)
- Can create new version (linked to original)
- DOI assigned at publication
- All versions preserved

**Fork and Modify:**
- Anyone can copy (fork) a public protocol
- Modify for their needs
- Credit original author
- **Git for lab techniques**

**Rich Annotations:**
- Link to code repos, datasets, equipment
- Step-by-step runnable format
- Images, videos, detailed metadata

**Application to DEIA:** This is basically our BOK workflow. We should copy this model.

---

### 5. Creative Commons Music Model

**Source:** Creative Commons, Freesound (100,000+ samples), ccMixter
**Status:** Proven for creative works (music, art, writing)

**Key learnings:**
- CC BY-SA works for music (copyleft for creative works)
- Attribution required for all except CC0
- NoDerivs prevents remixing (we don't want this)
- ShareAlike creates reciprocity

**Validation:** Our CC BY-SA choice for BOK is proven across creative domains

---

### 6. GitHub Fork/Pull Model

**Source:** GitHub collaborative development model
**Status:** Industry standard, well-understood

**Two models:**
1. **Fork and Pull** (open source) - Anyone can fork, changes pulled by maintainer
2. **Shared Repository** (teams) - Direct access to single repo

**For DEIA:** Fork and Pull model for BOK contributions
- Reduces friction for new contributors
- No upfront coordination needed
- Maintainers control what gets merged
- Pull requests = code review for knowledge

---

### 7. Constitutional AI (Anthropic)

**Source:** Anthropic research papers (public)
**Status:** Published methodology, freely studyable

**Key concepts:**
- Rules/principles instead of constant human oversight
- RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF)
- Collective input via Polis platform
- Transparency through explicit principles

**Criticism we should heed:**
- "If Constitutional is to mean anything, need democratic governance not technocratic automatism"
- **We need human participation, not just AI enforcing rules**

**Application to DEIA:** Our Constitution needs participatory governance (Ostrom principle #3)

---

### 8. Knowledge Commons Framework (GKC Research)

**Source:** Workshop on Governing Knowledge Commons (ongoing research)
**Status:** Active academic field, Cambridge Studies series

**Key insights:**
- Motivated by Ostrom's research style
- Empirical basis for understanding institutions for sharing knowledge
- Recent work: "Governing Misinformation in Everyday Knowledge Commons"
- Blockchain for digital commons (transparent record-keeping)

**Application to DEIA:** Align with GKC research community, cite their frameworks

---

## PART 2: STANDARDS BODIES (How They Work)

### BABOK (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge)

**Governance:** International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA)
**Contribution model:** Volunteer-driven, distributed collaboration

**How to contribute:**
- Submit articles to IIBA (earn 15 CDUs per published article)
- Must be original, not AI-generated, exclusive to IIBA
- Editorial Committee review
- Members-only access for some content

**Development process:**
- Consensus-driven
- Public review period (thousands of feedback items)
- Collective wisdom of global experts

**Takeaway:** Mix of open (public review) and closed (IIBA membership) + NO AI-GENERATED CONTENT RULE

---

### PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)

**Governance:** Project Management Institute (PMI)
**Status:** 7th edition released 2021

**Development:**
- Evolved from "recognized good practices" of practitioners
- Consensus-driven standards process
- Integrates enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets

**Governance in content:**
- Establishes strategic direction and performance parameters
- Aligns knowledge with organizational objectives
- Section 2.2.2 devoted to project governance

**Takeaway:** Standardization helps organizations, but requires tailoring to specific needs

---

### IEEE AI Standards

**Governance:** IEEE Artificial Intelligence Standards Committee
**Status:** Multiple active standards

**Key standards:**
- IEEE P2975.1 - Industrial AI data attributes
- IEEE 2894-2024 - Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies
- Governance criteria: safety, transparency, accountability, bias minimization

**Lifecycle approach:** Development through decommission
**AI & Knowledge Management:** Enhancing access, decision-making, knowledge graphs

**Takeaway:** IEEE focuses on AI governance, not human-AI collaboration patterns (gap)

---

## PART 3: WHAT ALREADY EXISTS (Competitive Landscape)

### AI Coding Assistants (Tools, Not Knowledge)

**What exists:**
- GitHub Copilot - code completion
- Microsoft IntelliCode - ML-trained on OS repos
- Tabnine - privacy-focused
- Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf - agentic dev

**What they do:** Assist with coding
**What they DON'T do:** Capture and share human-AI collaboration patterns

**Research finding (METR 2025):** Experienced OS devs are 19% SLOWER with AI
- Shows we don't understand how to use AI effectively
- **DEIA solves this by sharing what actually works**

---

### No Human-AI Collaboration Pattern Repository Found

**Search results:** Nothing found
- No platform for sharing prompting strategies
- No repository of meta-patterns (how to work with AI across domains)
- No privacy-preserving submission pipeline
- **DEIA IS NOVEL**

---

### HuggingFace (Model Hub, Not Interaction Patterns)

**What they do:** Share ML models, datasets
**Governance:** Community-driven with licensing
**What they DON'T do:** Share how humans and AI work together

**Gap:** Models ≠ interaction patterns

---

## PART 4: WARNING SIGNS (What Can Go Wrong)

### Stack Overflow: When Reputation Systems Go Bad

**Success story → Cautionary tale:**
- Reputation system initially drove quality
- High reputation = moderation privileges
- **Problem:** Gave moderation power to contributors, not moderators
- Became oppressive over time ("Stanford Prison Experiment")
- Moderation hardened into "process-heavy policing"
- Filtered out new voices instead of welcoming them

**Quote:**
> "The system filtered them out... moderation took on an oppressive tone as leaders systematically dismantled the quality"

**Lesson for DEIA:**
- Don't conflate contribution reputation with moderation authority
- Keep them separate
- Welcome new contributors, don't gatekeep
- Graduated sanctions (Ostrom #5), not immediate bans

---

### Tragedy of the Commons: Mostly Debunked

**The myth:** Commons always fail (Hardin 1968)
**The reality:** Hardin got history wrong

**Ostrom proved:** Commons work for centuries when properly governed
- Swiss cattle herders
- Japanese forest dwellers
- Philippines irrigators

**Real failures:**
- Grand Banks fishing (technology + lack of governance)
- S&L crisis (FSLIC made taxpayer money a commons without oversight)
- Netherlands carpool lane (couldn't organize)

**Lesson for DEIA:** Commons don't fail if we apply Ostrom's 8 principles

---

### Failed Open Source Projects

**Common failure patterns:**
1. **Governance failures** - Unaccountable core teams (Rust moderation crisis 2021)
2. **BDFL death** - Single maintainer dies, no succession plan
3. **Corporate abuse** - CLAs that let companies "pull the rug"
4. **Complexity beyond governance** - Projects too big for informal structures

**Lesson for DEIA:**
- Need succession planning (what if Dave gets hit by a bus?)
- Need multi-level governance (not just Dave)
- Need protection from corporate takeover
- Non-profit foundation (Dave already proposed this)

---

### Research Data Repositories Shut Down

**Statistics:** 6.2% of repositories shut down, median age 12 years

**Case study: BIIACS**
- Launched 2008
- Data Seal of Approval certified 2013
- Shut down 2018
- **Data no longer accessible, no successor named**

**Lesson for DEIA:**
- Plan for long-term sustainability from day 1
- Data escrow / successor agreements
- Non-profit structure for continuity beyond Dave

---

### GPL Enforcement: It Works But Requires Lawsuits

**Success cases:**
- D-Link (2006) - Legal precedent in Germany
- Fortinet (2005) - Court injunction forced compliance
- BusyBox (2007-2009) - Multiple lawsuits
- Cisco/Linksys (2008) - FSF sued
- Artifex v. Hancom (2017) - GPL is enforceable contract
- Stockfish v. ChessBase (2021) - GPLv3 violation

**Takeaway:** Reciprocity CAN be enforced, but expensive and slow

**Lesson for DEIA:**
- Need enforcement mechanism for reciprocity violations
- Legal path is proven but costly
- Prevention > cure (endorsement system, auditing, public registry)

---

### Predatory Journals: Fake Peer Review

**Problem:** Journals claim peer review but don't provide it
**Scale:** Researchers report constant spam invitations
**Detection:** Credible journals don't chase authors

**Lesson for DEIA:**
- Need spam prevention (endorsement system like arXiv)
- Need validation of reviewer identities (like Aldus Press)
- Need community reporting of predatory contributions

---

## PART 5: CRITICAL GAPS IN DEIA DESIGN

### 1. ❌ No Ostrom Alignment

**Problem:** We built Constitution without checking Nobel Prize-winning commons research
**Impact:** May miss proven governance patterns
**Fix:** Map DEIA to Ostrom's 8 principles, revise Constitution

---

### 2. ❌ No FAIR Compliance

**Problem:** BOK entries not designed for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
**Impact:** Reduces discoverability and reuse
**Fix:** Add FAIR metadata requirements to BOK template

---

### 3. ❌ No Endorsement System

**Problem:** Anyone can submit to BOK (spam risk)
**Impact:** Dave will drown in spam as DEIA grows
**Fix:** Adopt arXiv endorsement model (new contributors need sponsor)

---

### 4. ❌ No DOI Strategy

**Problem:** BOK entries not citable
**Impact:** Academic researchers can't cite our work
**Fix:** Register with DataCite, assign DOIs to BOK entries

---

### 5. ❌ No "Private by Default" Workflow

**Problem:** Current design assumes public sharing
**Impact:** Contributors can't draft privately before publishing
**Fix:** Adopt protocols.io model (private → share with select people → public)

---

### 6. ❌ No Fork/Modify Model

**Problem:** Can't build on others' BOK entries
**Impact:** Limits community remixing and improvement
**Fix:** Allow forking with attribution (GitHub model for knowledge)

---

### 7. ❌ No Version Immutability

**Problem:** Can published BOK entries be edited?
**Impact:** Could enable revisionist history, break citations
**Fix:** Published = frozen, improvements = new version (protocols.io model)

---

### 8. ❌ No Succession Planning

**Problem:** What if Dave dies/becomes incapacitated?
**Impact:** Project dies with Dave (like failed OSS projects)
**Fix:** Non-profit foundation with board, named successors

---

### 9. ❌ No Predatory Contribution Prevention

**Problem:** How to prevent spam, fake entries, low-quality submissions?
**Impact:** Quality degrades, Dave drowns in moderation
**Fix:** Endorsement + graduated sanctions + community reporting

---

### 10. ❌ No Blockchain Audit Trail

**Problem:** We mentioned blockchain but didn't commit
**Impact:** No tamper-proof record of contributions, disputes
**Fix:** Decide: Git commits + GPG OR real blockchain (Polygon?)

---

### 11. ❌ No Academic Institutional Relationships

**Problem:** No partnerships with universities, research labs
**Impact:** Miss credibility, funding, research collaborations
**Fix:** Reach out to GKC Workshop, MIT, Carnegie Mellon (human-AI interaction research)

---

### 12. ❌ No DataCite Registration

**Problem:** Can't assign DOIs without DataCite membership
**Impact:** BOK entries not citable in academic papers
**Fix:** University library partnership OR direct DataCite membership

---

### 13. ❌ No NIH-Style Mandate Pathway

**Problem:** NIH made data sharing REQUIRED in 2023 (game-changer)
**Impact:** DEIA is voluntary, limits adoption
**Fix:** Long-term: Work toward funding agencies requiring DEIA logging?

---

### 14. ❌ No Insider Threat Prevention

**Problem:** Trusted contributor goes rogue, leaks PII, sabotages
**Impact:** Privacy breach, reputation damage, legal liability
**Fix:** Audit trails, separation of duties, graduated trust levels

---

### 15. ❌ No Reputation System (But Stack Overflow Shows Dangers)

**Problem:** How to recognize good contributors without creating gatekeeping?
**Impact:** Either no recognition OR Stack Overflow-style oppression
**Fix:** Separate contribution credit from moderation authority

---

## PART 6: LICENSING & LEGAL MODELS

### Academic Publishing Model

**How it works:**
- Authors can post preprints with CC-BY license
- Then publish in journal with copyright transfer
- Both are legal and compatible

**For DEIA:**
- Contributors can share to BOK (CC BY-SA)
- Then write academic paper about same patterns (journal retains copyright)
- No conflict

---

### HIPAA Compliance (If Healthcare Domain)

**Two methods:**
1. **Safe Harbor** - Remove 18 specific identifiers (strict but safe)
2. **Expert Determination** - Statistical approach, very small re-identification risk

**For DEIA Healthcare BOK:**
- Need HIPAA compliance layer
- Probably Safe Harbor method (simpler, legally defensible)
- Additional review by healthcare privacy expert

---

### Defense/Government Classification

**Key findings:**
- NISPOM governs classified info sharing with cleared contractors
- Contractors can be derivative classifiers, NOT original classification authorities
- NOCONTRACTOR designation prohibits distribution to contractors regardless of clearance

**For DEIA Government Domain:**
- Separate instance for classified work?
- Or exclude classified entirely (only unclassified patterns)?
- Consult security clearance expert

**Dave's insight:** "Universal knowledge might be better protection than classification"
- Counterintuitive but interesting
- Needs expert input

---

## PART 7: FREELY USABLE LICENSES (Proven Models)

### 1. CC BY-SA 4.0 (BOK Content)
- **Proven for:** Music (Freesound), Wikipedia content, scientific data
- **Reciprocity:** ShareAlike = improvements must be shared
- **Status:** ✅ We chose this

### 2. MIT/Apache 2.0 (DEIA Tools)
- **Proven for:** Open source software
- **Goal:** Maximum adoption
- **Status:** ✅ We chose this

### 3. CC BY-ND (Constitutional Framework)
- **Proven for:** Foundational documents
- **Goal:** Can share, can't modify without governance
- **Status:** 🆕 Proposed (should we lock Constitution from edits?)

### 4. GPL (Strong Copyleft)
- **Proven for:** Software with reciprocity
- **Enforcement:** Legal precedent (15+ successful cases)
- **For DEIA:** Too restrictive for BOK, but model for reciprocity enforcement

---

## PART 8: WHAT WE CAN FREELY USE (Summary)

**Governance:**
- Ostrom's 8 principles (map DEIA to these)
- GKC Knowledge Commons Framework (align with academic research)
- Blockchain for digital commons (transparent governance)

**Technical:**
- FAIR principles (make BOK FAIR-compliant)
- arXiv endorsement system (spam prevention)
- Protocols.io workflow (private → public, fork, immutability)
- GitHub fork/pull model (contributions)
- DataCite DOIs (citability)

**Licensing:**
- CC BY-SA for BOK (proven)
- MIT/Apache for tools (proven)
- GPL enforcement precedent (legal backing for reciprocity)

**Quality Control:**
- Graduated sanctions (Ostrom, not Stack Overflow)
- Community moderation (Wikipedia model)
- Endorsement (arXiv model)
- Validation of identities (Aldus Press model)

---

17. **BABOK/PMBOK alignment** (for business/PM)
18. **IEEE standards engagement** (for AI governance)

---

## PART 10: QUESTIONS FOR DAVE

### Governance

**Q1:** Should we lock the Constitution (CC BY-ND) or allow community amendment?
**Q2:** Endorsement system - who can endorse new contributors? (Early trusted contributors? Domain maintainers?)
**Q3:** Blockchain - Git+GPG vs real blockchain? Cost/benefit?

### BOK Workflow

**Q4:** Private by default - should ALL BOK drafts be private until author publishes?
**Q5:** Version immutability - once published, frozen forever? Or allow corrections?
**Q6:** Fork/modify - should contributors be able to remix BOK entries with attribution?

### Scaling

**Q7:** When to form non-profit - wait for funding threshold? Contributor count? Year 1 regardless?
**Q8:** Academic partnerships - approach GKC Workshop now or wait until we have BOK entries?
**Q9:** DataCite registration - do we need university partnership or pay directly?

### Domain-Specific

**Q10:** Healthcare domain - HIPAA compliance from day 1 or wait?
**Q11:** Government/defense - separate classified instance or exclude entirely?
**Q12:** BABOK/PMBOK - formal alignment or just inspiration?
