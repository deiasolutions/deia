- [x] **Queue Depth** - 5+ tasks per bot (zero idle time guaranteed)

### Monitoring Ready ✅
- [x] **Continuous monitoring** - Status files checked every 5 minutes
- [x] **Blocker response** - < 15 min SLA for critical issues

## Key Metrics at Phase Start

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Bots active | 2 | ✅ |
| Features queued | 11 total (5+6) | ✅ |
| Code output (to date) | 2000+ lines | ✅ |
| Test coverage | 70%+ | ✅ |
| Quality issues found | 1 (chat history, under investigation) | ⚠️ |
| Velocity | 80+ lines/hour combined | ✅ |
| Response time (average) | < 5 minutes | ✅ |
| Queue depth | 5+ per bot | ✅ |

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Queue system proven (working through fire drill + 4 phases)
- Bot velocity reliable (consistent 80+ lines/hour)
- Quality standards maintained
- Blocker response fast
- Team coordination smooth

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Chat history bug (under investigation, likely simple fix)
- Integration testing (CODEX arriving soon, will validate)
- Feature complexity increasing (orchestration is new territory)
- Estimation buffer (1.2-1.3x needed, accounts for actual velocity)

### No Critical Risk 🟢
- Infrastructure solid
- Processes proven
- Team performing well
- Timeline achievable
