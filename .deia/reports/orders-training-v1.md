# Orders Training: Auto-Check, Rev, and Lightweight Instructions

## Auto-Check Loop (Drones)
Every 3-5 minutes, drones MUST:
1. Read `.deia/bot-status-board.json`
2. Compare the top-level `rev` (ISO timestamp) with your last applied value
3. If `rev` changed OR your bot's fields changed:
   - Sync your task to match the board
   - Send heartbeat: `Orders applied (<task_id>)`
   - Continue working

## Rev Field
- **Location:** Top-level of `bot-status-board.json`
- **Meaning:** ISO timestamp bumped by Queen when ANY order changes
- **Your action:** If different from last time you checked, you have new orders

## Lightweight Instructions
- **Source of truth:** JSON fields in status board (`task_id`, `status`, `expectation`)
- **Mirror file:** Your `.deia/instructions/BOT-XXXXX-instructions.md` - human-readable, not authoritative
- **Philosophy:** Keep instruction files focused; use board for dynamic updates
- **Scope:** Always verify `allowed_dirs` and `deny_dirs` before acting
