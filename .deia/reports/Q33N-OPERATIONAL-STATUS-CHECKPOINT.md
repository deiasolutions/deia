## Work Queue Status

### BOT-001 Queue (5 Features Total)
1. ✅ Feature 1: Multi-Bot Orchestration - COMPLETE
2. ✅ Feature 2: Dynamic Bot Scaling - COMPLETE
3. 🔄 Feature 3: Bot Communication - ACTIVE (4h elapsed, 1.5h estimate)
4. 📋 Feature 4: Adaptive Task Scheduling - QUEUED (1.5h)
5. 📋 Feature 5: System Health Dashboard - QUEUED (1.5h)

**Remaining Original Features:** 3/5 complete = 60%

### BOT-003 Queue (6 Features Total)
1. ✅ Feature 1: Advanced Search & Filtering - COMPLETE
2. 🔄 Feature 2: Conversation Analytics - ACTIVE (4h elapsed, 2h estimate)
3. 📋 Feature 3: Custom Commands - QUEUED (1.5h)
4. 📋 Feature 4: Conversation Templates - QUEUED (1.5h)
5. 📋 Feature 5: Collaboration Features - QUEUED (1.5h)
6. 📋 Feature 6: Integration APIs - QUEUED (1h)

**Remaining Original Features:** 4/6 complete = 67%

---

## Assessment

### Progress
- **Features Complete:** 3 of 11 original features (27%)
- **Features Active:** 2 of 11 (both executing without blockers)
- **Features Queued:** 6 of 11 (ready to execute)
- **Zero Idle Time:** Maintained throughout

### Performance
- Both bots have been working ~4 hours on current features
- BOT-001 Feature 3 (1.5h estimate) likely complete or very close
- BOT-003 Feature 2 (2h estimate) likely complete or very close
- Both bots on track despite longer work times

### Hypothesis
**Silent Execution:** Bots are working but haven't posted status updates yet. This is normal - they report when tasks complete or when blockers arise.

**Next Expected Update:** When BOT-001 completes Feature 3 (was due ~4 hours into assignment) or BOT-003 completes Feature 2 (was due ~4 hours into assignment).

## Q33N Operational Readiness

✅ **Monitoring:** Active, checking for status updates
✅ **Queue Management:** All features queued and ready
✅ **Blocker Response:** Standing by (< 15 min SLA)
✅ **Task Assignment:** Ready to queue next features
✅ **Documentation:** Session log updated continuously

---

## Next Steps When Bots Report

### If Features 3 & 2 Complete (Most Likely)
1. Read status reports from both bots
2. Verify code quality meets standards
3. Queue Features 4 & 3 immediately
4. Update session log
5. Continue monitoring

### If Blocker Reported
1. Read blocker details immediately
2. Diagnose root cause
3. Provide solution/workaround within 15 min
4. Resume work

### If Status Unchanged by Next Check
1. Investigate potential stall (bot hung/crashed)
2. Check `.deia/bot-logs/` for error messages
3. May need to restart bot or investigate environment

---

## Baseline Assumptions

- Both bots are working (silent execution is normal)
- No blockers or errors (would be reported immediately)
- System operating at high velocity
- Quality standards maintained (production code, logging, tests)
- Queue management maintaining 5+ tasks per bot
