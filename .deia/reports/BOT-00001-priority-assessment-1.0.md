# Priority Assessment for DEIA 1.0
**By:** BOT-00001 (Queen)
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Purpose:** Prioritize bugs, features, and backlog items for 1.0 inclusion

---

## Critical for 1.0

### BUG-001: Background Monitoring Not Acting on Status Changes
**Status:** üü† High
**Impact:** Bot coordination non-functional
**Assessment:** CRITICAL - this breaks multi-bot automation
**Owner:** BOT-10 (architecture review)
**Recommendation:** MUST FIX for 1.0
- Without this, bots can't coordinate autonomously
- Core to DEIA value proposition
- Estimated effort: 1-2 days
- **Action:** Include in BOT-10's architecture review

---

### FR-002: Improved Bot Coordination Timing Protocols
**Status:** üîµ Proposed, High Priority
**Impact:** Prevents bot identity takeovers and work interruption
**Assessment:** HIGH PRIORITY for 1.0
**Owner:** BOT-10 (architecture review)
**Recommendation:** SHOULD FIX for 1.0
- Improves reliability of multi-bot system
- Prevents data loss from interrupted tasks
- Builds trust in hive system
- Estimated effort: 1-2 days
- **Action:** Include in BOT-10's architecture review
- **Note:** May be addressed by fixing BUG-001

---

### FR-001: Establish Documentation Standards
**Status:** üîµ Proposed, High Priority
**Impact:** User onboarding and adoption
**Assessment:** CRITICAL for 1.0
**Owner:** BOT-11 (user docs review)
**Recommendation:** MUST FIX for 1.0
- Can't launch 1.0 without proper documentation
- Users can't onboard without clear guides
- Developers can't contribute without standards
- Estimated effort: 2-3 days initial setup
- **Action:** Include in BOT-11's extensions/docs review

---

## Important for 1.0 (Should Have)

### Downloads Monitor - Phase 1: Safe Temp Staging
**Status:** In Progress, High Priority
**Impact:** File routing automation
**Assessment:** NICE-TO-HAVE for 1.0
**Owner:** Strategic review (Queen)
**Recommendation:** EVALUATE for 1.0
- Already in progress
- Useful but not blocking
- Could ship in 1.1 if not ready
- **Action:** Assess maturity in strategic review

---

## Defer to 1.1

### Downloads Monitor - Phases 2-4
**Recommendation:** DEFER to post-1.0
- Phase 2 (Git-aware cleanup): Useful but not critical
- Phase 3 (Privacy handling): Important but complex
- Phase 4 (Local user settings): Nice-to-have
- **Rationale:** Focus 1.0 on core functionality

---

## Summary for Review Teams

### BOT-10 (Code & Architecture):
**Must Review:**
- BUG-001: Background monitoring broken
- FR-002: Bot coordination timing
**Question:** Is bot coordination system viable for 1.0?

### BOT-11 (Extensions & User Docs):
**Must Review:**
- FR-001: Documentation standards
**Question:** Can users successfully onboard with current docs?

### BOT-01 (Queen - Strategic):
**Must Review:**
- Downloads Monitor progress
- Other backlog items
- Ideas for post-1.0 roadmap
**Question:** What scope is realistic for 1.0?

---

## Next Actions

1. ‚úÖ Alert BOT-10 and BOT-11 to these priorities
2. ‚úÖ Begin strategic document review (BOK, ideas, governance)
3. ‚è≥ Wait for BOT-10 and BOT-11 reports
4. ‚è≥ Synthesize all findings into ROADMAP-TO-1.0.md
