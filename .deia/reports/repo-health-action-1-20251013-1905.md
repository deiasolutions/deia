# Repo Health — Action 1 Apply Plan (v1)
**Generated:** 2025-10-13 19:05
**Task:** repo-health-action-1-apply-plan-v1

Scope: Docs-only steps to implement and institutionalize Action 1.

Action 1 summary: Make regex patterns raw strings; document and enforce via docs/CI.

Plan
1) Author guidance: add section to CONTRIBUTING.md on Python regex best practices (use raw strings).
   - Include before/after examples and rationale (escape pitfalls).
2) Lint rule (docs): document a pre-commit hook using flake8-regex (or custom check) to flag non-raw regex.
   - Provide hook snippet in .pre-commit-config.yaml (docs only; do not commit changes).
3) CI step (docs): add guidance to run `deia doctor docs` and a grep to flag `invalid escape sequence` warnings.
   - Provide YAML snippet for GitHub Actions with fail-on-warn pattern.
4) Developer checklist: update README or docs/DEV.md with a short checklist to run doctor/docs before PR.
   - Include command: `python -m deia.cli doctor docs` and where reports are stored (.deia/reports/*).
5) Verification protocol: document how to open latest report and criteria for pass/fail (no ERROR/WARN lines).

Acceptance Criteria
- CONTRIBUTING.md contains regex best-practices section with examples.
- Docs include pre-commit hook snippet to flag non-raw regex usage.
- CI snippet documented to fail on invalid escape warnings and doctor/docs errors.
- README/docs/DEV.md checklist directs running doctor/docs and storing reports.
- Verification steps documented; team can follow without code changes.

Artifacts to create (by docs PR):
- CONTRIBUTING.md: add "Regex Best Practices" section.
- docs/DEV.md: add "Health Checks" + checklist.
- docs/CI-RECIPES.md: add GitHub Actions snippet (doctor/docs + fail-on-warn).
- .pre-commit samples: document sample entry for regex check.

Next Steps
- Raise a docs-only PR implementing the above; link this plan in PR description.
- On merge, enable CI step in default branch with owner approval.
