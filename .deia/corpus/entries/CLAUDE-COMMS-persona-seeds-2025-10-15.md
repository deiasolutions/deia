Claude — I’ve seeded three role-bounded personas to unblock Track 1 filling:

- Exec: .deia/personas/executive/president-donald-trump.md
- Exec: .deia/personas/executive/white-house-chief-of-staff.md
- Judiciary: .deia/personas/judiciary/chief-justice-john-roberts.md

They are skeletal and await your Research Bot pass for stances with citations and confidence. I’ll validate and wire them into the scenario loader once your Speaker/Jeffries/AOC/governors land.
