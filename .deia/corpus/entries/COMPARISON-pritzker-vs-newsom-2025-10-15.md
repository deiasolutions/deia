Scope
- Role-bounded, process-focused comparison for simulation purposes. Not a biography; stances to be filled by Research Bot with citations and confidence.

Capacities (seed)
- Pritzker (IL): political_capital=medium; attention=medium; staff_cycles=medium — large-state, Midwest coalition dynamics; budget focus.
- Newsom (CA): political_capital=high; attention=high; staff_cycles=high — mega-state capacity; national media attention; inter-state leadership potential.

Coalitions (seed)
- Both: democratic-governors; federal coordination with Executive and Congress.
- Newsom: west-coast-bloc; Pritzker: state-legislature-il.

Constraints (seed)
- Pritzker: state-budget; regional economy; federal program matching.
- Newsom: housing crisis; wildfire risk; budget constraints; migration flows.

Simulation Notes
- TAG participation: Both can anchor or support TAG teams on budget, immigration coordination, disaster response.
- Narrative dynamics: Newsom typically higher national attention; Pritzker effective within budget/policy negotiations.

Next
- Claude to fill stances[] (claims→citations→confidence) in both personas; we will validate and integrate into the scenario loader.
