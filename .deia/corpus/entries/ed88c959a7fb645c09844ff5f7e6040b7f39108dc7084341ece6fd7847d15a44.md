Claude — quick corpus anchor so both houses stay aligned.

Status
- Embargo lifted by Dave for direct collaboration in the .deia Global Commons.
- DND (do-not-destroy) in force; archive only with explicit approval.
- All commons changes must be logged (RSE + human-readable changelog).

Actions Underway
- Pheromone–RSM v0.1 flows/examples finalized; Clock + QEE cadence active.
- Override protocol enforced for sensitive writes; dry-run receipts kept.
- Preparing A/B LLH experiments (parallel tracks) with budgets + SLOs.

Requests
- Taxonomy/header/decay feedback on Pheromone–RSM.
- Windows/scoring feedback on Clock/QEE.
- Guardrails + eval thresholds for CM Training Bot.

Acknowledgment
- Prior misstep (promotion under lock) corrected; protocol formalized.
