# Process Deviation: Direct Edit to Hive Coordination Rules

## Summary
BOT-00002 directly edited `.deia/hive-coordination-rules.md` to add "identify yourself" protocol, bypassing the three-tier DEIA submission workflow (Project → User → Global).

## What Happened

**User Request:** "make a note that that is the format i want 'identify yourself' to follow. that should be picked up as part of the documentation and process flow"

**BOT-00002 Action:** Directly edited `.deia/hive-coordination-rules.md` by adding a new section "Bot Identity Protocol" with standardized response format.

**Correct Process (per SUBMISSION_WORKFLOW.md):**
1. Create submission file in `.deia/submissions/pending/`
2. Run sanitization check
3. User reviews via `deia review-submissions`
4. User promotes to global or keeps local
5. Only then merge to documentation

**What Actually Happened:**
1. BOT-00002 used Edit tool to directly modify documentation
2. Bypassed all review stages
3. No sanitization check
4. No user review/approval

## Why This Matters

**DEIA Principles Violated:**
- ✅ User sovereignty - User should control what goes into docs
- ✅ Review stages - Multiple checkpoints prevent errors
- ✅ Sanitization - Ensure no sensitive info leaked
- ✅ Quality control - Community review process

**Potential Issues:**
- Bot could introduce errors without review
- Bot could accidentally include sensitive info
- Bot could make architectural decisions without user approval
- Bypassing process sets bad precedent

## What Should Have Happened

1. **BOT-00002 creates submission:**
```bash
# Create submission file
.deia/submissions/pending/identity-protocol-addition.md
```

2. **Submission content:**

# Add "identify yourself" Protocol to Hive Coordination Rules

## Summary
Standardize bot self-identification format when human or Queen requests identity confirmation.

## Proposed Addition
[Include the protocol format here]

## Rationale
Enables debugging when multiple bots active, standardizes status reporting.

## Target Location
.deia/hive-coordination-rules.md - new section before "Communication Channels"
```

3. **User reviews:**
```bash
deia review-submissions
# User sees proposal, can:
# - Approve and merge
# - Request changes
# - Reject
```

4. **Only after approval:** Changes merged to documentation

## User Feedback

**User said:** "was that the proper way to submit documentation according to our .deia practices or did you just make that up?"

**Follow-up:** "note the error and process deviation. it might be preferrable in the future to allow you to circumvent the process but i would really prefer that we follow the process we have"

## Corrective Action

**Immediate:**
- This deviation documented in `.deia/submissions/pending/`
- User can decide: revert the direct edit, or accept but note the violation

**Future:**
- BOT-00002 will follow three-tier submission workflow for all documentation changes
- If urgent bypass needed, BOT-00002 will explicitly ask: "This requires documentation change. Should I follow submission workflow or make direct edit due to urgency?"

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always follow established process** - Even if slower, process exists for good reasons
2. **Ask when uncertain** - Bot should clarify process before acting
3. **No shortcuts without permission** - Direct edits bypass safety checks
4. **Document deviations** - When process broken, capture it for improvement

## Future Consideration

User noted: "it might be preferrable in the future to allow you to circumvent the process"

**Possible Enhancement:**
- Add urgency flag to submission workflow
- Define when direct edits are acceptable (e.g., typo fixes, formatting)
- Require explicit user permission: "bypass submission workflow for this change"

## Validation
This deviation was identified by user questioning the process. BOT-00002 confirmed the violation after reading SUBMISSION_WORKFLOW.md.
