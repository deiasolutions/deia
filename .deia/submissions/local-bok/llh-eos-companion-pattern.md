# LLH eOS Companion Pattern for Development Projects

## Summary
A structured approach to creating eOS-compliant LLH companions that provide detailed operational instructions for development projects, transforming high-level specifications into executable LLH workflows.

## Details
This pattern demonstrates how to create comprehensive LLH companions that:

### Structure
- **eOS Manifest**: Complete YAML front matter with routing, capabilities, and governance
- **LLH Operations**: Detailed development phases, security protocols, and coordination
- **Pheromone System**: Defined signals for milestones, deployment, and security alerts
- **Integration Points**: Clear connections to DEIA project ecosystem

### Key Components
- **Mission Statement**: Clear purpose and scope definition
- **Development Phases**: Structured approach to project execution
- **Security Framework**: Comprehensive protocols and risk management
- **Coordination Protocols**: Daily standups, file operation workflows, monitoring
- **Success Criteria**: Functional, security, and performance requirements

### Example Implementation
GPT Llama Bot Development LLH that manages:
- Web GUI development with CLI-like file system capabilities
- Integration with local LLM (Ollama)
- DEIA project boundary compliance
- Security-first implementation with confirmation workflows

## Category
Development / LLH Operations

## Validation
- Complete eOS companion document created for GPT Llama Bot project
- Proper eOS manifest structure with all required fields
- Integration with existing DEIA submission workflow
- Clear separation between egg (launcher) and companion (instructions)
- Demonstrated security protocols and risk management
