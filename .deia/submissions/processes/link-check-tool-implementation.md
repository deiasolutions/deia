- Title: Link Check Tool Implementation for Markdown Documentation
- Date: 2025-10-13
- Owner: BOT-00002
- Scope: DEIA Tools / Documentation Quality Assurance

1) What you tried to do
- Create a Python-based link checker tool (`.deia/tools/link_check.py`) to scan all markdown files in the repository and identify broken internal file links
- Generate a comprehensive report listing all broken links by file with line numbers
- Enable documentation quality assurance and link maintenance

2) Your solution/process
- Created `.deia/tools/link_check.py` (Python 3.9+ compatible)
- Features implemented:
  - Recursive markdown file scanning with smart directory filtering (skips .git, node_modules, etc.)
  - Markdown link extraction using regex pattern: `\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^\)]+)\)`
  - Link validation for local file links (skips external URLs, anchors)
  - Relative path resolution from source file location
  - Markdown and JSON output formats
  - Windows Unicode encoding handling

- Steps:
  1. Scan repository for .md files
  2. Extract all markdown links from each file
  3. Validate local file links exist
  4. Generate report with broken links grouped by file
  5. Save to `.deia/reports/link-check-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md`

- Success criteria:
  - Tool successfully scans all markdown files
  - Report generated with summary statistics
  - Broken links identified with file paths and line numbers
  - No crashes or encoding errors

- Rollback plan:
  - Delete `.deia/tools/link_check.py` if tool doesn't meet requirements
  - Report files in `.deia/reports/` are non-destructive (can be deleted)

3) Cost & Telemetry
- Tokens (prompt/completion/total): ~10K tokens (tool creation + testing)
- Duration: ~15 minutes (including one encoding error fix)
- Events logged:
  - Started: 2025-10-13T11:42:28 [BOT-00002] Working link-check
  - Completed: 2025-10-13T11:46:48 [BOT-00002] Report written

4) Worker Usage
- Workers invoked: link_check
- Counts: 1 invocation
- Arguments: "md-scan"
- Result: ok
- Logged via: `.deia/tools/worker-log.ps1`

5) Evidence
- Tool created: `.deia/tools/link_check.py` (251 lines)
- Report generated: `.deia/reports/link-check-20251013-1143.md`
- Scan results:
  - Files scanned: 357
  - Total links: 752
  - Valid links: 686
  - Broken links: 66
  - Files with issues: 21
- Heartbeat logs: `.deia/instructions/BOT-00002-instructions.md` (lines 68-69)
- Worker usage log: Recorded via worker-log.ps1

6) Recommendation for the collective
- Classify: process tool | documentation quality assurance
- Why it should be added:
  - Enables proactive link maintenance (identify broken links before they cause issues)
  - Automated quality checks for documentation
  - Provides clear actionable reports with file paths and line numbers
  - Useful for any project with markdown documentation
  - Python-based (no external dependencies)
  - Cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/macOS)

- Proposed location in `bok/`:
  - Tool: `bok/tools/documentation/link-checker/` or keep in `.deia/tools/`
  - Process: `bok/patterns/documentation/link-checking-workflow.md`

- Benefits:
  - Catch broken links during development
  - Maintain documentation integrity
  - Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines
  - Supports multiple output formats (markdown, JSON)

Appendix

Open questions:
- Should the tool check external URLs (HTTP/HTTPS) in addition to local files?
  - Currently skipped to avoid network dependencies and rate limiting
  - Could add as optional flag: `--check-external`

- Should we add anchor validation (check if #section-name exists in target file)?
  - More complex, requires parsing markdown headers
  - Could be Phase 2 enhancement

- Integration with CI/CD?
  - Could add pre-commit hook to check modified files
  - Could add GitHub Action to run on PRs

Future improvements:
1. Add `--fix` mode to suggest corrections for common issues
2. Add `--external` flag to optionally check HTTP/HTTPS URLs
3. Add anchor validation for internal document section links
4. Add ignore patterns via config file (e.g., `.linkcheck-ignore`)
5. Add caching to avoid re-scanning unchanged files
6. Add parallel processing for large repositories
7. Generate diff report showing new broken links since last scan

Technical notes:
- Unicode encoding issue encountered on Windows (cp1252 codec error)
- Fixed by adding fallback to UTF-8 via sys.stdout.buffer.write()
- Tool handles both file and directory input paths
- Relative paths resolved correctly from source file's directory
