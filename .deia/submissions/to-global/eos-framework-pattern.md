# eOS (Ephemeral OS) Framework Pattern

## Summary
A comprehensive operating system layer for DEIA that manages the lifecycle, coordination, and execution of organizational entities (Eggs, LLHs, TAGs) through formal kernel, process model, and inter-process communication systems.

## Details
eOS provides a structured approach to managing ephemeral organizational entities within the DEIA ecosystem:

### Core Components
- **Kernel**: ROTG + DND policy enforcement, manifest validation, routing engine
- **Process Model**: Manages Eggs, LLHs, TAGs, and Services with defined lifecycle
- **IPC System**: RSE (Routine State Events) for coordination via JSONL
- **Scheduler**: DEIA Clock, QEE (Queue Execution Engine), Egg Incubator
- **Filesystem**: Project-based routing with segmentation

### Key Features
- **Egg-First Architecture**: All entities begin as eggs (genetic blueprints)
- **Manifest-Driven**: All entities declare capabilities, routing, and policy
- **Append-Only IPC**: All coordination via RSE in JSONL format
- **Project Segmentation**: Workloads isolated in `.deia/projects/<name>/`
- **Security**: Virus definition and prevention mechanisms

## Category
Architecture / Operating System Layer

## Validation
- Complete specification document created (`docs/os/eOS-SPEC-v0.1.md`)
- Boot flow documentation (`docs/os/eOS-BOOT-FLOW.md`)
- Validator integration plan (`docs/os/eOS-VALIDATOR-PLAN.md`)
- Template implementations for LLH entities
- Integration with existing DEIA tools and workflows
