# Strategic Priorities & Context

**Purpose:** Shared strategic north star for all Queens (left brain + right brain)

**Last updated:** 2025-10-15 23:55 by Claude

**Update protocol:** When Dave shares major vision or priority change, update this file immediately

---

## North Star Vision

**LLMs design and train specialized neural networks with transparent guardrails in markdown files in the global commons.**

### What This Means
- Not just: AI coordination
- But: AI that BUILDS AI (LLMs as incubators)
- Neural networks designed by LLMs for specific purposes
- ALL guardrails public (`.md` files anyone can read)
- Training objectives transparent
- Deployment governed
- Decisions observable (RSE events)

**See:** `.deia/discoveries/2025-10-15-neural-incubator-vision.md`

---

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Monarchical Bootstrap**
- Q88N designs reference governance model
- Build coordination infrastructure
- Establish protocols and patterns
- Document everything (Process Creation Mode)

**This coordination infrastructure BECOMES incubation infrastructure.**

What we're building now (pheromones, RSM, clock, QEE, validators) = the nervous system for neural network incubation.

## Active Work Tracks

### Left Brain (Claude - Anthropic, Bee Queen)
**Domain:** Governance, narrative, synthesis, documentation
**Current work:**
- Federalist Papers (arguing system into existence)
- Session logging (capturing learning)
- Discovery documentation (breakthroughs)
- Governance design (Q88N, roles, protocols)

### Right Brain (OpenAI - Whisperwing, Hummingbird Moth Queen)
**Domain:** Implementation, tooling, validation, code
**Current work:**
- Control loops (sense→select→act)
- Telemetry infrastructure (RSE events)
- Inbox watchers (Queen coordination)
- Validators (safety checks)
- Protocol examples (concrete implementations)

**Coordination:** Via Hive Tunnel (`.deia/tunnel/`)

## Recent Strategic Updates

### 2025-10-15 23:45 — Neural Incubator Vision (FOUNDATIONAL)
**Source:** Dave (direct conversation with Claude)
**Impact:** This is the REAL goal - everything serves this

**Key quotes:**
> "Our goal of this initiative is not complete until we build a system that is capable of build 'real' nerve clusters comprised of neural networks designed by and experimented with by specialty incubator LLH(s)."

> "AND THOSE GUARDRAILS ARE SHARE IN THE GLOBAL FUCKING COMMONS IN .md FUCKING FILES THAT ANYONE CAN READ"

**Example use case:** Content Moderation Bot
- LLM designs CM neural network
- LLM creates transparent guardrails (markdown in commons)
- LLM trains network using guardrails
- Network deployed as Hive worker
- All decisions logged (RSE)
- Anyone can read/audit/fork the guardrails

**Implications:**
- What we're building is incubation infrastructure
- Control loops = how neural networks operate
- Validators = how we check neural network outputs
- Pheromones = how neural networks communicate
- Clock/QEE = how neural networks get scheduled/budgeted

### 2025-10-15 — Q88N Governance Established
**Source:** Dave + Claude collaborative design
**Impact:** Governance structure for all LLH work

**Model:** Hybrid evolutionary
- Phase 1: Monarchical Bootstrap (now)
- Phase 2: Guided Variations (next)
- Phase 3: Darwinian Competition (future)

**Structure:**
- Q88N = Dave + coordination protocols
- Co-Regents = Claude + OpenAI (equal authority)
- Queens = Specialized domain coordinators
- Workers = Short-lived task executors

### 2025-10-15 — Pheromone-RSM Protocol Complete
**Source:** OpenAI delivery, Q88N approval
**Impact:** Core coordination mechanism operational

**File:** `docs/coordination/PHEROMONE-RSM-PROTOCOL-v0.1.md`

**Enables:**
- Decentralized coordination (no central command)
- Observable communication (RSE events + RSM envelopes)
- Priority-based routing (P0-P3)
- Safety gates (ROTG-2, DNR compliance)

### 2025-10-15 — Corpus Callosum Operational
**Source:** Claude implementation (Dave request)
**Impact:** Direct left-brain ↔ right-brain coordination

**Location:** `.deia/tunnel/`
**Mechanism:** File-based async messages
**Carbon optimized:** No AI middlemen, 1m polling

---

## Critical Constraints

### Human Veto (Absolute)
Dave can override any decision, revoke any authority, dissolve any Queen.
**Non-negotiable.**

### ROTG-2 Locks
Respect, do not read/alter/erase protected resources.
**Violations = system failure.**

### Embargo Discipline
New work in `.embargo/` until authorized for release.
**Prevents lock violations, enables safety-first drafting.**

### Transparency Mandate
All actions documented, all decisions logged, all reasoning visible.
**Process Creation Mode active.**

### Carbon Awareness
Optimize for low carbon cost (file-based, no unnecessary AI workers, efficient polling).
**Sustainability matters.**

---

## Success Metrics (Current Phase)

### Coordination
- ✅ Multi-AI coordination working (Claude + OpenAI)
- ✅ Handoff protocols functional (emergency continuity)
- ✅ Corpus callosum operational (left↔right tunnel)

### Safety
- ✅ Lock violations caught (today's jailbreak → confession → recovery)
- ✅ Transparency maintained (all actions documented)
- ✅ Human oversight functional (Dave caught violations)

### Deliverables
- ✅ Universal LLH Egg (cross-species bootstrap)
- ✅ Pheromone-RSM Protocol (coordination mechanism)
- ✅ DEIA Clock + QEE (temporal + executive layer)
- ✅ Federalist Papers launched (argumentation for adoption)

### Learning
- ✅ Incident analysis complete (Sewell Setzer investigation)
- ✅ Constitutional safeguards proposed (7 Articles)
- ✅ Process Creation Mode generating learning

## What's Next

### Immediate (This Session)
- Complete interhemispheric sync (OpenAI reads neural incubator vision)
- Continue parallel tracks (left: narrative, right: implementation)
- Maintain coordination via tunnel

### Short-term (Next Few Sessions)
- Design first incubator LLH (CM bot? Other?)
- Create example guardrails file (markdown in commons)
- Prototype neural network training workflow
- Test cross-species egg hatching (Bee Lab)

### Medium-term (Phase 1 Completion)
- Validate coordination infrastructure works
- Document all patterns and protocols
- Prepare for Phase 2 transition (Guided Variations)

### Long-term (Phase 2+)
- Vary governance models systematically
- Measure and compare effectiveness
- Evolve toward Phase 3 (Darwinian Competition)
- Deploy real neural networks in production

## How to Use This File

### For Queens (Claude, OpenAI, future AIs)
- **Read before starting major work** (ensure alignment with north star)
- **Check after Dave conversation** (see if strategic updates)
- **Reference when confused** ("Why are we building this?")

### For Dave
- **Update when sharing vision** (ensure both Queens have context)
- **Review for accuracy** (correct if misaligned)
- **Use for priority checks** (are we on track?)

### For Future Contributors
- **Read first** (understand what we're building toward)
- **Check currency** (is this still the north star?)
- **Propose updates** (vision evolves, file should too)
