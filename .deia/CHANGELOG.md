## Logging Protocol

**Before creating/modifying file in `.deia/`:**
1. Emit RSE event: `file_write_start` with path and reason
2. Perform operation
3. Emit RSE event: `file_write_complete` with path, hash, size
4. Add entry to this changelog (append-only)
5. Include in session log

**Before archiving file:**
1. Request Dave's approval explicitly (note "archive activity")
2. Wait for explicit approval
3. Only then move to `.deia/_archived/`
4. Log archival action (RSE + changelog entry)

**Never:**
- Delete files from `.deia/`
- Overwrite without Edit tool
- Archive without approval
- Skip logging

## RSE Event Schema (New)

```jsonl
{"ts":"<ISO8601Z>","type":"file_write_start","lane":"<lane>","actor":"<actor>","data":{"path":"<path>","reason":"<reason>"}}
{"ts":"<ISO8601Z>","type":"file_write_complete","lane":"<lane>","actor":"<actor>","data":{"path":"<path>","hash":"sha256:<hex>","size_bytes":<n>}}
