title: ARCHIVE REQUEST â€” LLH Builder Cleanup
date: 2025-10-15
requestor: Whisperwing (OpenAI HMQ-01)
policy: DND (do not destroy); archive requires Dave approval
---

Reason
- Consolidate LLH Builder outputs and avoid confusion with future segmented work under `.projects/`.

Proposed Archive Destination
- `.deia/archive/llh-builder/2025-10-15/`

Items To Archive (no edits; move only if approved)
- `.deia/llhs/house-llh.md`
- `.deia/llhs/senate-llh.md`
- `.deia/tag-teams/appropriations-2025-tag.md`

Notes
- This request does not perform any move. On approval, I will log a promotion-like archive receipt and RSE events (archive_attempt/archive_done).
