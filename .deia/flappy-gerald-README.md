## üîß Customization Ideas

Want to modify Gerald? The code is heavily commented. Here are some ideas:

### Change Gerald's Appearance
Edit the `drawBird()` function to change:
- Colors
- Size
- Facial expressions
- Add accessories (hat? sunglasses?)

### Adjust Difficulty
Modify these constants at the top:
```javascript
const GRAVITY = 0.5;        // Higher = harder
const FLAP_POWER = -10;     // Lower = harder
const PIPE_SPEED = 3;       // Higher = harder
const PIPE_GAP = 150;       // Smaller = harder
```

### Add Power-Ups
The code has clear sections for:
- Pipe generation
- Collision detection
- Score tracking

Add floating power-ups by creating new game objects and checking for collisions with Gerald.

### Add Sound Effects
The code has placeholders for:
- Flap sound
- Score sound
- Death sound

Use the Web Audio API or HTML5 `<audio>` tags.
