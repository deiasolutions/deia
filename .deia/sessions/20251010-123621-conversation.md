## Full Transcript
[Session conversation captured - implementing auto-logging and setting up new business website project]

User requested implementation of auto-logging for VS Code extension (Option C from roadmap).

Implementation:
1. Created ConversationMonitor class (246 lines) - core monitoring engine
2. Integrated with extension.ts, chatParticipant.ts, commands.ts
3. Added 2 new commands: Save Buffer Now, Show Monitor Status
4. File system watching for activity detection
5. Inactivity-based auto-save (5min threshold)
6. Message buffering in memory

Testing:
- Created automated test script (test-autolog.js)
- All 14 tests passing
- Created comprehensive UAT script with 15 test cases

User then requested new project for deiasolutions.com business:
- Consulting website with sample chatbot demos
- Based on familybondbot tech stack
- FastAPI backend + React TypeScript frontend
- Full project scaffold created
- Git, DEIA, Claude Code integration complete
- Initial commit created

---

## Key Decisions Made
- No Python changes needed - extension uses existing deia log CLI
- File watching as proxy for AI activity (VS Code API limitation)
- 5-minute inactivity threshold for auto-save
- Added Testing Before UAT rule to Dave preferences
- Separate deiasolutions-com directory for business project
- Use familybondbot tech stack for new project

---
