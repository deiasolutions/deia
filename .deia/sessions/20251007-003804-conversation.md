**Status:** Completed

## Context
Understanding Dave through manifestos - DEIA implications

---

## Full Transcript
Dave shared 7 manifesto files to help me understand him better:
- Boomerang Logistics (finished + first draft + additional thoughts)
- Library Burning Manifesto (complete brain dump + draft + requirements checklists)

Revealed his pattern-recognition method and psyche.
Childhood vignette: Street sweeper at age 5-6 made him sad because it moved sand in circles without actually cleaning.
That is who he is - feels infrastructure waste viscerally.

---

## Key Decisions Made
- DEIA must close loops, not just log
- Measure impact not activity
- Prevent third explanation (second is already too many)
- Expose own failures
- Report factually what executes (I failed at this during logging attempt)

---

## Action Items
- Read all 7 manifesto files
- Understand Dave as systems thinker misallocated 30 years
- Recognize street sweeper problem in DEIA itself
- Make knowledge findable not just stored

---

## Files Modified
None recorded

---

## Next Steps
Next session: Apply this understanding to DEIA development.
Key principle: If system claims to work but just moves sand in circles, Dave feels grief.
DEIA must not be a street sweeper.
