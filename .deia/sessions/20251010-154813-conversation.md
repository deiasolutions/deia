## Full Transcript
User: read project_resume.md

Claude: [Reads project_resume.md and executes full startup sequence]
- Read project_resume.md
- Read .claude/STARTUP.md
- Read .claude/STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md
- Read .claude/REPO_INDEX.md
- Read .claude/INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Read ~/.deia/dave/preferences.md
- Read ROADMAP.md
- Checked .deia/config.json (auto_log: true)
- Announced: Auto-logging active

User: i would like it noted that Claude Code worked this time. I just opened three different VSCode windows, opening terminal, launching Claude and giving it the instruction read project_resume.md and it worked. In each window, Claude read the content and gave the launch validation I would want to see for Deia and my coding preferences, with autologging noted as on. I would like to document the documents which made this possible. Can you put together something I can post as an example of Deia working, showing code blocks, pointing to the repo, etc. And I would like an entry made to the BOK for Claude Code with python script or cli or both in code blocks, plus text explaining the purpose, and containing the appropriate metadata. And so lets do this. Do not create either of those notes yet, lets talk about this. How do we make a BOK entry for this, so others can see it and other Claude Code users can follow those steps even if they do not want to install deia.

Claude: [Provided detailed analysis with 6 decision points]
- BOK Entry Structure options (A/B/C)
- Audience split considerations
- File sharing approach
- Personal preferences handling
- Demo post location
- Demo format options

User: do this for me, record the question and the prompts you would give for each answer, so we can come back to it. record the progress of where we are and next steps according to our coding practices, which if they are not now will soon be codified. but i see there is a lot of text for me to review in the last couple responses, and i will want you to spoon feed me that info later. After you do that, do a final log update, and ask me whats next

Claude: Created decision documentation at .deia/private/notes/20251010-bok-documentation-decisions.md with:
- 6 decision points with A/B/C/D options
- Spoon-feed prompts for later review
- Next steps in order
- Technical notes and metadata


---

## Key Decisions Made
- Claude Code startup protocol works reliably across multiple windows
- Need to document this success in BOK entry
- Need to create demo post showing DEIA working
- Created decision document with 6 questions for Dave to review later
- Will spoon-feed options when Dave is ready

---

## Action Items
- Completed: Validated startup protocol in 3 VS Code windows
- Completed: Identified 8 core files that make it work
- Completed: Created decision document (.deia/private/notes/20251010-bok-documentation-decisions.md)
- Pending: Spoon-feed 6 decisions to Dave at his pace
- Pending: Get A/B/C/D answers
- Pending: Draft BOK entry based on decisions
- Pending: Create demo post
- Pending: Publish and announce

---

## Files Modified
- `.deia/private/notes/20251010-bok-documentation-decisions.md`

---

## Next Steps
Wait for Dave to indicate ready for decision review. Then spoon-feed questions one at a time. Once decisions made, draft BOK entry and demo post for review.
