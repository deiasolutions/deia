# 2025-10-09 Session: Crash Recovery, Privacy Audit & Infrastructure Setup

## Session Start: Crash Recovery

**User:** read project_resume and look for claude instructions. we're recovering from a crash. i need to know where we are and if anything was lost.

**Assistant:** Reads project_resume.md and session logs. Discovers:
- Last session: 2025-10-07 building conversation logger
- Next step was: "Test the logging system with a real conversation"
- Logger infrastructure exists but conversation capture mechanism missing
- Current phase: Phase 1 (basic install)

**Recovery Status:** Nothing critical lost. Session log captured high-level work. All modified files tracked in git.

## Business Model Clarification

**User:** my chat with Claude ai looking at claude-project-briefing and it says there is ambiguity about business model? We're offering this for free but seeking support from people who will want to help support the project...

**Assistant:** Found ambiguity in CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md at lines 293-296 (open questions about monetization).

**Fixed:** Updated to clearly state:
- DEIA is free and always will be
- Community-funded via donations/sponsorships
- Goal: Cover Dave's dev costs + future infrastructure
- Dave has full-time job but would rather work on DEIA

## Privacy Infrastructure Setup

**User:** look for any doc that might have pii information for me, the only thing I want know about me is that I'm Dave and dave-atx.

**Assistant ran PII scan:**

**Found 6 instances of "Dave Eichler":**
1. README.md line 284
2. docs/decisions/0001-extension-python-installation-strategy.md line 5
3. docs/postmortems/logger-claims-vs-reality-rca.md line 320
4. docs/claude-code/project-resume-pattern.md line 406
5. docs/claude-code/clarifying-questions-policy.md line 186
6. CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md line 340 (also had "@davee" handle)

**All fixed:** Changed to "Dave (@dave-atx)"

**No other PII found:** ✓ No emails, phones, addresses, employer info, location data

## Private Directory Structure Created

**User:** And let's carve out a space where my private docs and conversations go.

**Assistant created:**

1. **Repo-level private (`.private/`):**
   - Private docs with PII
   - Strategic notes not ready for public
   - CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md moved here

2. **Project-level private (`.deia/private/`):**
   - Unsanitized conversation logs
   - Draft submissions before sanitization
   - Personal project notes
   - Every DEIA user gets this

**Rationale discussed:**
- User preferences (TDD, coding practices) → `~/.deia/dave/preferences.md` (PUBLIC, for all AIs)
- Claude-specific → `.claude/` (PUBLIC, tool-specific)
- Repo private → `.private/` (Dave's private workspace for THIS repo)
- Project private → `.deia/private/` (per-user, per-project workspace)

**Files created:**
- `.private/README.md` (usage guide)
- `.private/docs/CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md` (moved)
- `.private/docs/PRIVACY_AUDIT_2025-10-09.md` (audit report)
- `.deia/private/README.md` (usage guide)
- `.deia/SANITIZATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` (submission guidelines)

**.gitignore updated:**
```
# Private directories (never commit)
.private/
.deia/private/
```

Verified: Neither directory appears in git status ✓

## Auto-Logging Discovery

**User:** ok. now where were we before the crash. and have you confirmed we can autolog?

**Assistant:** Discovered NO logs from today (2025-10-09). Last log: 2025-10-07.

**User:** shit the date is 10/9, do you not have any conversation records from today?

**Assistant:** Confirmed - nothing logged from today's work. This proves the logging gap.

**User:** you have done autologging before. on 10/7 we were able to recover from a crash because you had been recording things without me needing to tell you to log more than once

**Assistant:** Investigated October 7 sessions. Found:
- `.claude/INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Auto-log procedures exist
- `.claude/preferences/deia.md` - Startup behavior defined
- Instructions say: Check auto_log status, log at breakpoints when enabled

**Discovery:** Config had `auto_log: false` (should be true)

**User:** autolog should be TRUE. can you see who changed it?

**Assistant investigation:**
- File is gitignored (no git history available)
- Last modified: Oct 9, 2025 at 8:09 PM (today, ~20 min before this check)
- Created: Oct 7, 2025 at 3:56 PM
- Someone/something changed it today

**User:** dave's pref is for autolog to be on in all deia projects

**Assistant:** Fixed - set `auto_log: true` in config

## Files Modified Today

**Public docs (PII fixes):**
- README.md (Dave Eichler → Dave (@dave-atx))
- docs/decisions/0001-extension-python-installation-strategy.md
- docs/postmortems/logger-claims-vs-reality-rca.md
- docs/claude-code/project-resume-pattern.md
- docs/claude-code/clarifying-questions-policy.md
- .gitignore (added .private/ and .deia/private/)

**Private files created:**
- .private/README.md
- .private/docs/CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md (moved from docs/)
- .private/docs/PRIVACY_AUDIT_2025-10-09.md
- .deia/private/README.md
- .deia/SANITIZATION_REQUIREMENTS.md

**Config fixed:**
- .deia/config.json (auto_log: false → true)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Privacy architecture:** Separate repo-level (.private/) from project-level (.deia/private/) private spaces
2. **Public identity:** Only "Dave" and "@dave-atx" allowed in public docs
3. **Business model clarity:** Free forever, community-funded, no ambiguity
4. **Auto-log preference:** Always enabled in DEIA projects
5. **Sanitization workflow:** Draft in private → Sanitize → Submit to DEIA Global

## Next Steps

- Continue logging at breakpoints (now that auto_log is enabled)
- Document today's changes for user
- Update project_resume.md with this session
