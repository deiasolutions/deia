# Efemera Investigation Session (2025-10-15)

## Context
User requested investigation into work done yesterday evening (Oct 14, 2025, after 17:00). Specifically looking for evidence of "Efemera vs Aliendas" game and "Efemera Live" platform work.

## Findings

### Work Completed Yesterday (17:00-23:02)

1. **Efemera vs. Aliendas Game** (17:00-19:06)
   - Location: `games/efemera-vs-aliendas/`
   - Complete JavaScript space shooter with 17+ game modules
   - Cockpit UI, enemy waves, combat system, telemetry
   - Status: COMPLETE and functional

2. **Efemera Live Documentation** (22:00-23:01)
   - Created comprehensive specs:
     - `docs/efemera/EFEMERA-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE-v0.1.md` (22:30)
     - `docs/specs/Efemera-Build-Spec-v2.0.md` (22:51)
     - `docs/projects/Efemera-Social-Edge-Graft-Outer-Egg-v0.1.md` (22:11)
     - `docs/observability/RSE-0.1.md` (22:26)
     - `docs/comms/BL-2025-10-14-efemera-kickstart.md` (23:01)

3. **Partial Egg Hatch** (22:53-23:02)
   - `src/efemera/rse.py` - RSE logging helper (created 22:53)
   - `services/identity_dev/main.py` - FastAPI identity service (created 23:02)
   - `run_identity_dev.bat` - Windows run script

### Directories Found

**Keep (legitimate work):**
- `docs/efemera/` - Documentation
- `games/efemera-vs-aliendas/` - Functional game
- `games/versions/efemera-vs-aliendas-v0.1/` - Game backup
- `src/efemera/` - RSE helper library

**Evaluate for cleanup:**
- `services/identity_dev/` - Egg hatch artifact (functional but partial)
- `run_identity_dev.bat` - Launch script for identity service

### Critical Shortcoming Identified

**Issue:** Lack of documented evidence trail for egg hatch
- The Social Edge Graft Egg contains a complete `hatch.sh` script
- Evidence shows `services/identity_dev/` was created manually, not via hatch script
- No RSE telemetry logs exist (`.deia/telemetry/rse.jsonl` not found)
- No DEIA session log from Oct 14 evening work
- Timestamps show code created 22:53-23:02, but no execution logs

**Implications:**
1. Cannot verify what was actually executed vs. what was planned
2. Cannot trace decision-making process during implementation
3. Violates DEIA observability principles (RSE events should exist)
4. Cannot determine if hatch was abandoned mid-execution or never started
5. Cannot resume work with confidence about system state

**Root Cause:**
- Session logging may not have been active during Oct 14 evening work
- RSE logging was implemented but never actually executed/tested
- Identity dev service references RSE logging but no events were emitted

### Recommendations

1. **Cleanup Decision Needed:** Keep or remove `services/identity_dev/`?
2. **Establish Logging:** Ensure DEIA session capture active before proceeding
3. **Test RSE Pipeline:** Verify RSE logging works before building on it
4. **Fresh Start Protocol:** If going forward, document the baseline clearly

## Action Items
- [x] User decision on cleanup approach: **Option B - Keep & Continue**
- [ ] Verify DEIA auto-logging active
- [ ] Test RSE logging end-to-end
- [ ] Document Phase 0.5 baseline

## Decision: Option B - Keep & Continue

**User (Dave) chose:** Keep the working code and continue from current baseline.

**Keeping:**
- `services/identity_dev/main.py` - Functional FastAPI service (3.3KB)
- `run_identity_dev.bat` - Windows launch script
- `src/efemera/rse.py` - RSE logging library
- All documentation in `docs/efemera/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/projects/`

**Documented as:** Phase 0.5 baseline (partial egg hatch, functional identity service)

**Next Steps:**
1. Test identity_dev service works
2. Document Phase 0.5 as baseline
3. Decide implementation path forward

**Session Owner:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Investigation Time:** 2025-10-15 (morning)
**Status:** Investigation complete, Option B selected, moving to baseline documentation
