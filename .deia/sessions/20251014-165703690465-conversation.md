**Status:** Active

## Context
Efemera The Game pivot + v0.1 build + v0.2 spec.
Built Drone-Lite drones + orchestrator; created flappy egg; pivoted to forward-facing space shooter.
Playable v0.1 vertical scroller scaffolded (LR + shoot). Added run_game.bat. Planned v0.2 features.

---

## Full Transcript
(See CLI transcript; summarizing major steps here.)

---

## Key Decisions Made
- Adopt nested eggs: Outer -> Egg-01/02/03
- Ship v0.1 prototype quickly, iterate in small patches
- Pivot POV: looking into space, enemies approach
- Controls: 4-direction, mouse/joystick support
- Serve game via local HTTP (run_game.bat)

---

## Action Items
- Implement 4-dir input + mouse/gamepad
- Add starfield + moon launch scene
- Depth-scaling enemies + center-origin waves
- Rear-view HUD + banners + scoring (v0.2)
- Landing sequence tied to Threat (later eggs)

## Update: 2025-10-14T16:59:29.196693

Quality Incident Report: Missed early DEIA logging.

Summary:
- Logging was not started at project kickoff; began midstream after v0.1 build.

Impact:
- Reduced traceability for early decisions and file changes.
- Minor risk to reproducibility of initial scaffold steps.

Root Cause:
- Logging step not codified in hatch specs; relied on manual trigger.

Corrective Actions (Now):
- Created active session log and backfilled high-level context, decisions, and files.
- Enabled plan to append updates per feature patch.

Preventive Actions (Next):
- Update Outer Egg to v0.1.1 with mandatory Logging Policy & Hatch Payload: start DEIA session on hatch.
- Add acceptance in Egg-02+ that a session exists and contains actions.
- Provide a one-click script to start server and append session milestones (optional).

## Update: 2025-10-14T17:07:49.553556

Changes: Snapshot v0.1 to games/versions/efemera-vs-aliendas-v0.1; added Windows README; implemented 4-direction input (keyboard/mouse/gamepad); added starfield and Moon launch scene; updated player boundaries; wired new states (menu→launch→play). Next: depth-scaling enemies and center-origin waves.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T17:09:29.730312

Implemented approaching enemies with depth scaling and center-origin waves (burst, spiral, arc). Updated enemies movement/culling/collisions; modified waves to use spawnApproach. Ready for playtest via run_game.bat.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T17:30:05.232439

Customer note captured: cockpit view with visible cannons, reticle control, tracer rounds, weapon pickups (guns/hydrogen), solar panel orientation and damage, K-Pop Demons future. Implemented slice: reticle + twin cannons with alternating fire, tracer bullets, pickups (rapid/spread; hydro reserved), course drift with thrusters (Shift/A gamepad), starfield parallax with course, rear-view Earth widget, enemies now drop pickups on kill. Next: solar grid damage indicator, enemy projectiles causing drift and panel loss, banner/UI polish.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T17:42:41.358387

Graphics + gameplay pass: added circle drawing; Moon is now round. Reticle gained glow. Enemies now converge on player (homing toward reticle) and have states: active -> disabled -> debris, requiring extra hits. Debris lingers. Updated main to pass reticle to enemy AI.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T17:51:29.603694

Added static art mockups (SVG + HTML) for cockpit view: round Moon, starfield, cannons, reticle, UFO/debris, pickups, rear-view Earth, resource bars, and 16-bit-style solar grid. Paths: games/efemera-vs-aliendas/art/cockpit-mockup.svg and .../cockpit-mockup.html.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T18:02:50.610646

Aligned live render to the SVG mock: cockpit overlay with frame, round Moon (offset with course), upgraded cannon visuals with rounded mounts + muzzle flash, UFOs as ellipses, removed legacy player block from draw, added resource bars and solar grid overlay. Ready for visual review.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T18:11:17.088244

Adjusted pacing and controls per feedback: slowed early waves, spawn 1–2 approachers with gaps; added friendlies (green) with detector icon; bullets ignore friendlies; reduced homing strength & speed. Fixed keyboard reticle range by disabling mouse easing when mouse idle.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T18:31:55.934418

Process updates: added EFEMERA-DEV-PROCESS.md with telemetry, change-tracking, and bot API requirements. Updated Outer Egg v0.1.1 (Observability & AI hooks) and Egg-03 acceptance (telemetry + GameAPI). Wired Telemetry and BotAPI in-game. Added backlog item for PlayerBot-Train-v0.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T18:36:13.767981

BUG-002 filed: SyntaxError redeclaration of const off in main.js. Fix: renamed first off to courseOff; updated telemetry. Awaiting verification; will close upon confirmation.


---

## Update: 2025-10-14T18:43:40.619241

Implemented offscreen spawn with detection: enemies spawn beyond screen, show WARNING: INCOMING and directional arrows until entry; then approach→stage→dive sequence. Waves updated to use spawnIncoming.
