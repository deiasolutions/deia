## Context
DEIA iDea methodology documentation and Idea system architecture planning

---

## Full Transcript
User requested exploration of DEIA iDea and Idea concepts across repositories.

Claude searched deiasolutions and familybondbot repositories, finding comprehensive iDea documentation showing agile sprint framework for human-AI collaboration with defined roles and 5-phase workflow.

User clarified strategic direction:
- iDea methodology: PUBLIC in deiasolutions
- Idea (agentic system): PRIVATE in deiasolutions-labs under daaaave-atx
- Super secret, completely firewalled

User refined the architecture:
- Development method: DEIA iDea
- Separate entity: deiasolutions-labs
- Idea = Intelligent Development Environment Automation
- Agentic product dev startup team (all roles: CEO to coder to customer)

Claude created public documentation (3 files, fully sanitized):
1. Root overview (/IDEA_METHOD.md)
2. Complete documentation (/docs/methodologies/idea-method.md)
3. BOK submission (/bok/methodologies/idea-method.md)

User requested local-only reference for Idea system location.
Claude created: ~/.deia/dave/idea-system-reference.md
- Documents future location: daaaave-atx/deiasolutions-labs
- Explains public/private separation
- Local-only, not committed

Updated ROADMAP.md with DEIA iDea branding and version tracking.

Discussed IP protection feature:
- Track redactions and content types
- Hash sensitive information
- Report anonymized usage to DEIA Global
- Privacy-preserving telemetry

User triggered log with prepare to reboot.

## Key Decisions Made
- DEIA iDea is the PUBLIC methodology (human-AI collaborative framework)
- Idea (Intelligent Development Environment Automation) is PRIVATE agentic implementation
- Idea lives in separate repo: daaaave-atx/deiasolutions-labs (super secret)
- One-way dependency: Idea implements iDea, but iDea does not know about Idea
- Created complete public documentation for iDea methodology
- Created local-only reference document for Idea system location
- Brand is DEIA iDea for the unified methodology

---

## Action Items
- Created /IDEA_METHOD.md (public overview)
- Created /docs/methodologies/idea-method.md (full documentation)
- Created /bok/methodologies/idea-method.md (BOK submission)
- Created ~/.deia/dave/idea-system-reference.md (local-only Idea reference)
- Updated ROADMAP.md with DEIA iDea branding
- Pending: Create deiasolutions-labs repo (private, under daaaave-atx)
- Discussed: IP protection and redaction tracking feature for DEIA

---

## Files Modified
- `IDEA_METHOD.md`
- `docs/methodologies/idea-method.md`
- `bok/methodologies/idea-method.md`
- `~/.deia/dave/idea-system-reference.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`

---

## Next Steps
Next session:
1. Create deiasolutions-labs repo (PRIVATE, daaaave-atx account)
2. Design Idea agentic architecture
3. Implement IP protection and redaction tracking
4. Build Idea on top of iDea methodology
