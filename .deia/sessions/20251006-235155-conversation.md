## Context
Followed DEIA process: identified bootstrap bug, created GitHub issues #1 and #2, updated backlog

## Full Transcript
Full conversation about DEIA bootstrap failure, bug submission process, GitHub issue creation

## Key Decisions Made
- Used DEIA bug submission process from CONTRIBUTING.md
- Installed gh CLI to create issues programmatically
- Used Write+mv workaround for backlog.md edit failures

---

## Action Items
- Created Issue #1: Claude Code bootstrap fails
- Created Issue #2: Claude does not know DEIA processes
- Added both to admin/backlog.md
- TODO: Fix Issue #1 - Update installer.py template
- TODO: Fix Issue #2 - Create CAPABILITIES.md

---

## Files Modified
- `admin/backlog.md`

---

## Next Steps
Fix the two bugs: update installer.py to include sys.path workaround, create CAPABILITIES.md for bootstrap
