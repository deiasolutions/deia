## Key Decisions Made
- Priority 1: Build conversation logging system (insurance against crashes)
- Storage location: .deia/sessions/ (gitignored, timestamped)
- Filename format: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-{topic}.md for chronological sorting
- Automatic INDEX.md generation for quick lookup
- Three access methods: slash command, CLI, Python API
- Structured log format: 7 sections (metadata, context, transcript, decisions, actions, files, next steps)
- Auto-update project_resume.md on every log creation
- Include top 3 decisions and 5 files in resume summary
- Reverse chronological order in project_resume.md
- Separate detailed logs from quick summaries
