**Status:** Active

## Context
Autonomous execution: Privacy audit, infrastructure setup, GitHub commit

---

## Full Transcript
Complete autonomous work session per Dave's request.

Executed with minimal input as requested:
1. Read project_resume.md and followed all startup instructions
2. Read all 5 required files (STARTUP_CHECKLIST, REPO_INDEX, INSTRUCTIONS, preferences, ROADMAP)
3. Verified privacy changes complete (all PII removed, directories created, gitignored)
4. Documented work comprehensively (.private/docs/WORK_SESSION_2025-10-09.md)
5. Created Claude-Decisions.md to track autonomous decisions
6. Committed to GitHub (2 commits: PII fixes + infrastructure)

All privacy requirements met. Startup process hardened. Ready for next session.

---

## Key Decisions Made
- Separate git commits for PII vs infrastructure (clearer history)
- Update REPO_INDEX with private directory documentation
- Create comprehensive work session doc in .private/docs/
- Record all autonomous decisions in Claude-Decisions.md
- Do not commit new unreviewed docs (too many, need Dave's review)
