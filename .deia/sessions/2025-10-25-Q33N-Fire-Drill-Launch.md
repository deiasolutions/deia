## Critical Findings from Situational Awareness

### DEIA Hive Status (Pre-Fire Drill)
- **Phase 1:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Oct 18)
  - DEIA installable and loggable
  - 276 tests passing, 38% coverage
  - Real-time logging working

- **Phase 2:** üöÄ IN PROGRESS
  - Master Librarian spec complete (1,212 lines)
  - Context Loader implementation complete (90% coverage)
  - Agent BC building Pattern Extraction (10h ETA)
  - Query Router integrated (82% coverage)

**Hour 2-4:** BOT-001 task queue + registry, BOT-003 controls + messaging
**Hour 4-6:** BOT-001 testing, BOT-003 routing + status panel
**Hour 6-9:** Full integration, hardening, buffer time
**Hour 9+:** CODEX arrives, code review begins, sprint 2 work continues

---

## Q33N Monitoring During Fire Drill

**Every 30 minutes:**
- Check bot status files
- Resolve blockers within 30 min
- Update progress

**Status files monitored:**
- `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-001-fire-drill-status.md`
- `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-003-fire-drill-status.md`
- `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-001-questions.md`
- `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-003-questions.md`

---

## Technical Decisions

### Why This Approach?
1. **Fire drill first** - Get bots working before hardening
2. **Parallel execution** - BOT-001 and BOT-003 can work independently until hour 3
3. **Sprint 2 ready** - No decision delays when bots complete
4. **CODEX integration** - Pre-planned QA tasks for immediate execution

### Known Constraints
- Claude Code subprocess spawning historically problematic
- Dashboard was file-watching focused (wrong approach)
- Need chat-based bot control (not monitoring dashboard)
- 9 hour window before Codex available

### Mitigations
- Task assignments broken into 3-5 specific items
- Clear success criteria for each task
- Coordinated dependencies documented
- Blocker escalation path clear (30 min response time)

---

## Next Checkpoints

**Hour 4 (22:45 CDT):** Integration point
- BOT-001: Tasks 1-4 complete?
- BOT-003: Tasks 1-4 complete?

**Hour 6 (00:45 CDT):** Testing phase
- Both bots working end-to-end?
- Any critical blockers?

**Hour 9 (03:45 CDT):** Fire drill complete

- ‚úÖ Can launch bots from UI button
- ‚úÖ Chat accepts commands
- ‚úÖ Bots execute and respond
- ‚úÖ Messages appear real-time
