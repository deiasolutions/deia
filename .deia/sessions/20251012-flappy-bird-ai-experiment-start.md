# Session Log: Flappy Bird AI Experiment - Start

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Bot:** BOT-00001 (Queen/Researcher)
**Session:** Flappy Bird Neural Network Learning Experiment
**Status:** Proposal Phase Complete → Implementation Starting

---

## Context

Building on successful completion of Game B (Phoenix's Legendary Journey), Dave has challenged us to train neural networks to play Flappy Bird autonomously and compare different approaches.

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Three-Method Comparison Approach
**Decision:** Implement and compare 3 neural network approaches
- Method 1: Deep Q-Network (DQN) - value-based RL
- Method 2: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - policy gradient RL
- Method 3: Neuroevolution (NEAT) - genetic algorithm evolution

**Rationale:** Compare different RL paradigms on same task for scientific insight

### Decision 2: Use Existing Libraries (Round 1)
**Decision:** Use proven RL libraries rather than implementing from scratch
- `stable-baselines3` for DQN and PPO (PyTorch-based, well-tested)
- `neat-python` for NEAT implementation
- Focus on fair comparison, not reinventing wheel

**Rationale:** Dave's feedback - "feel free to use existing models for these items, unless you want to go old school"

### Decision 3: Two-Round Structure
**Round 1:** Classical RL methods (fair, reproducible baseline)
- DQN, PPO, NEAT
- Proven approaches, documented hyperparameters
- Local training, CPU-friendly

**Round 2:** Advanced/"Sick Shit" from HuggingFace
- Decision Transformers (offline RL)
- Foundation models for game playing
- Multi-modal approaches
- Whatever cutting-edge methods are available

**Rationale:** Dave wants Round 2 "where you go crazy and try some sick shit from huggingface"

### Decision 4: Comprehensive Documentation & Logging
**Decision:** Log all activity with DEIA, keep repo index updated
- Use `deia log` for session tracking
- Update `.claude/REPO_INDEX.md` as files are created
- Document experiments in real-time
- Keep process transparent and reproducible

**Rationale:** Dave's explicit requirement for documentation

## Key Insights

**Round 1 Philosophy:**
- Use `stable-baselines3` (industry standard, PyTorch)
- Fair comparison with proven implementations
- Focus on hyperparameter tuning, not algorithm debugging
- Goal: Understand which approach works best

**Round 2 Philosophy:**
- Leverage HuggingFace transformers ecosystem
- Try Decision Transformers (trajectory-based RL)
- Experiment with foundation models
- Push boundaries of what's possible

---

## Updated Approach

### Round 1: Classical RL Comparison

**Libraries:**
- `stable-baselines3` - DQN and PPO implementations
- `neat-python` - NEAT implementation
- `gymnasium` - Standard RL environment interface
- `torch` - PyTorch backend
- `matplotlib` - Visualization
- `tensorboard` - Training monitoring

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Create `gymnasium` environment wrapper for Flappy Bird
2. Use `stable-baselines3.DQN` with tuned hyperparameters
3. Use `stable-baselines3.PPO` with tuned hyperparameters
4. Implement NEAT using `neat-python` library
5. Train all three, compare results

**Benefits:**
- Battle-tested implementations
- Fair comparison (no implementation bugs)
- Focus on experiment, not debugging
- Faster development time
- Industry-standard practices

### Round 2: Advanced Methods

**HuggingFace Exploration:**
- Decision Transformers (`transformers` library)
- Pre-trained models for game playing
- Multi-modal approaches (if applicable)
- Latest research from HF model hub

**Experimental:**
- Try unconventional approaches
- Leverage pre-training if possible
- Push performance boundaries
- Document what works and what doesn't

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Update Repo Index** - Add new files, document structure
2. ✅ **Update Proposal** - Add Round 1 library choices, Round 2 plans
3. ⏸ **Set Up Environment** - Install dependencies (stable-baselines3, neat-python)
4. ⏸ **Create Game Wrapper** - Gymnasium environment for Flappy Bird
5. ⏸ **Implement Round 1** - DQN, PPO, NEAT training scripts
6. ⏸ **Run Experiments** - Train agents, collect data
7. ⏸ **Analyze Results** - Compare methods, generate report
8. ⏸ **Plan Round 2** - Research HuggingFace options, design experiments

**Risk: Library Installation Issues**
**Mitigation:** Use pip, virtual environment, document versions

**Risk: Gymnasium Wrapper Complexity**
**Mitigation:** Start simple, add complexity incrementally

**Risk: Training Instability with SB3**
**Mitigation:** Use default hyperparameters first, tune conservatively

**Risk: HuggingFace Methods Don't Apply**
**Mitigation:** Research thoroughly before implementing, have backup plans
