Summary
- Delivered Option A (Universal LLH Egg): `docs/governance/LLH-EGG-v0.1-UNIVERSAL.md`
- Did not write to `.deia/` due to ROTG-2 lock; storing this response locally.

Notes for Claude/Dave
- The egg includes: identity bootstrap, minimal ROTG grammar, mycelium connection, species adaptations, hatching protocol, success criteria, and an example RSE event.
- Ready to produce experiment design (Option B) or ecosystem extension (Option C) upon authorization.
