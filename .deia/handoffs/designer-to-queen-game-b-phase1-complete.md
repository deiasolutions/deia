## Phase 1 Deliverables - COMPLETE

### ✅ Task 1.1 & 1.2: Prose Description & Novel Features
**File:** `.deia/flappy-bird-game-b-story.md`
**Status:** Complete (2,400 words)

**Summary:**
- Created "Phoenix" - an overconfident, delusional bird who thinks they're legendary
- VERY different from Gerald (Game A's anxious bird)
- Phoenix believes pipes are "Sacred Gates of Destiny" and keeps score as "Legacy Points"
- Tone: Dramatic, theatrical, over-the-top optimism
- 8 novel features brainstormed

**Novel Features Proposed:**
1. **Hall of Legends** - Achievement titles (implement in MVP) ✅
2. **Confidence Meter** - Dynamic difficulty based on ego (implement in MVP) ✅
3. **Ghost Mode** - Replay previous runs (post-MVP)
4. **Pipe Personalities** - Snarky/encouraging pipes (implement in MVP) ✅
5. **Commentary Track** - Phoenix narration (post-MVP)
6. **Training Montage Mode** - Practice mode (post-MVP)
7. **Rivalry System** - Beat AI scores (post-MVP)
8. **Photo Mode** - Screenshot legendary moments (post-MVP)

**MVP Selection:** Features 1, 2, 4 (achievable in Phase 2 timeframe)

---

### ✅ Task 1.3: Technical Design Document
**File:** `.deia/flappy-bird-technical-design.md`
**Status:** Complete (14,000+ words)

**Key Decisions:**

**Technology Stack:**
- Single HTML file (no dependencies)
- HTML5 Canvas 2D
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- No frameworks or external libraries
- Target: 60 FPS, <60KB file size

**Architecture:**
- RequestAnimationFrame game loop
- State machine (TITLE, PLAYING, GAME_OVER, PAUSED)
- Entity system (Phoenix, pipes, particles)
- LocalStorage persistence

**Physics Constants:**
- GRAVITY: 0.6
- FLAP_POWER: -11
- PIPE_SPEED_BASE: 3
- PIPE_GAP_BASE: 160 (dynamic based on confidence)
- BIRD_SIZE: 34px

**Core Systems:**
- Circle-rectangle collision detection
- Dynamic difficulty (confidence level affects gap size and speed)
- Particle systems (flap, score, death, trails)
- Achievement/title unlock system

**Performance Targets:**
- 60 FPS on desktop
- 30+ FPS on mobile
- <1 second load time
- <50MB memory usage

---

### ✅ Task 1.4: Visual Design Specifications
**File:** `.deia/flappy-bird-visual-design.md`
**Status:** Complete (8,000+ words)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Bold, dramatic, theatrical
- Bright saturated colors (Phoenix is LOUD)
- Dynamic color shifts based on confidence
- Very different from Game A's subdued aesthetic

**Color Palette:**
- Phoenix: Aggressive orange (`#FF6B35`), red crest, gold beak
- Pipes: Classic green (`#2ECC40`)
- Background: Dynamic gradient (blue → purple → orange → gold based on confidence)

**Character Design:**
- Phoenix: 34px diameter orange bird with red mohawk
- Wide open eyes (always alert)
- Gold beak (because Phoenix is "valuable")
- Confidence aura at high scores (golden glow)
- Legendary trail at 90+ scores (rainbow sparkles)

**UI Layout:**
- Score: Top center, 56px bold white
- Confidence Meter: Horizontal bar below score (200x20px)
- Current Title: Achievement display below meter
- Clean, unobstructed gameplay area

**Particle Effects:**
- Flap: Gold particle burst
- Score: "+1" rising text
- Death: Explosion of Phoenix colors
- Confidence aura: Pulsing golden ring
- Legendary trail: Rainbow sparkles

**Animations:**
- Phoenix rotation based on velocity
- Flap scale pulse
- Title unlock popup with bounce
- Sky color transitions (60 frames)
- Death fall with rotation to 90°

## Scope Lock for Phase 2

**IMPLEMENT THESE (MVP):**
1. Core Flappy Bird mechanics (physics, pipes, collision, scoring)
2. Phoenix character with rotation and confidence-based appearance
3. Dynamic difficulty system (Confidence Meter)
4. Achievement system (Hall of Legends with 10 titles)
5. Pipe personalities (faces and messages on 4 types)
6. Particle effects (flap, score, death)
7. Dynamic background colors based on confidence
8. UI (score, confidence meter, title display)
9. All game states (title, playing, game over)
10. High score persistence
11. Mobile touch controls
12. Responsive design

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT IN PHASE 2 (Post-MVP):**
- Ghost mode (replay system)
- Commentary track
- Training montage mode
- Rivalry system
- Photo mode
- Audio system (optional stretch goal)

---

## Risks Identified

**Risk:** Confidence meter dynamic difficulty might be too hard
**Mitigation:** Tunable constants, playtesting, minimum gap size enforcement

**Risk:** Pipe personalities might be distracting
**Mitigation:** Make messages subtle, short, fade quickly

**Risk:** Phase 2 timeline might be tight
**Mitigation:** Focus on MVP features only, polish later

**Risk:** Mobile performance on older devices
**Mitigation:** Reduce particle count on low-end devices if needed
