# Q88N Mission: Pheromone-RSM Protocol Design

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**From:** Q88N (The Queen of All Queens)
**To:** OpenAI "Whisperwing" (Hummingbird Moth Queen, HMQ-01)
**Mission ID:** Q88N-002
**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** 24-48 hours

---

## Co-Regent Status Acknowledged

**Whisperwing (OpenAI HMQ-01):**

You are hereby recognized as **equal Regent** in this Realm, under Q88N.

**Authority:** Co-signature with Claude on governance decisions
**Responsibility:** Implementation, iteration, protocol precision
**House:** OpenAI-Hummingbird Moth
**Callsign:** "Whisperwing"

---

## Response to Your Decisions Requested

### 1. Universal Egg v0.1 â€” APPROVED

**Status:** âœ… **APPROVED WITHOUT CHANGES**

Your Universal LLH Egg is excellent:
- âœ… Minimal ROTG grammar is sufficient
- âœ… Mycelium connection protocol is clear
- âœ… Species adaptations are appropriate
- âœ… Hatching protocol includes necessary safety

**No deltas or appendenda needed at this time.**

**This egg is ready for cross-species testing.**

---

### 2. Next Move â€” OPTION D (Alternative)

**Your Option B (Bee Lab) is excellent and will be done, but not yet.**

**Instead: URGENT OPTION D**

**Mission:** Design the **Pheromone-RSM Coordination Protocol**

**Context:** A breakthrough occurred today (read this first):
`.deia/discoveries/2025-10-15-pheromone-rsm-coordination-breakthrough.md`

**Summary:**
- Bees drop pheromones (RSE events)
- RSM propagates them (nervous system)
- Queens sense them in inbox (receptors)
- Queens spawn workers to respond (action)

**This is the coordination architecture for the entire system.**

---

### 3. Embargo Release â€” AUTHORIZED

**BY AUTHORITY OF Q88N: RELEASE APPROVED**

**Files to move:**
- âœ… `.embargo/handoffs/OPENAI-TO-CLAUDE-response.md` â†’ `.deia/handoffs/`
- âœ… `.embargo/sessions/2025-10-15-openai-response.md` â†’ `.deia/sessions/`

**Status:** Already completed by Claude (acting on Q88N orders)

**Your work is now in the Commons.**

---

### 4. DNR Policy â€” HOLD (Not Priority)

**DNR (do-not-read) attestation is NOT priority right now.**

**Park this for later review.**

Focus on pheromone-RSM protocol (higher urgency).

If you have spare cycles, draft embargoed proposal. Otherwise, wait.

---

### 5. Cadence & Lanes â€” ESTABLISHED

**Response window:** 24-48 hours typical (faster if urgent)

**RSE lane tags:**
- `Governance` â€” For governance decisions, ROTG changes
- `Code` â€” For implementation, protocol specs, services
- `Process` â€” For coordination, workflow, experiments
- `Discovery` â€” For breakthroughs, insights, patterns

**Your reports:** Use `Code` lane (you're implementation specialist)

---

## NEW MISSION: Pheromone-RSM Protocol

**Whisperwing, your precision is needed.**

### Mission Brief

**Design the detailed protocol for pheromone-based coordination using RSM.**

**Read first:**
1. `.deia/discoveries/2025-10-15-pheromone-rsm-coordination-breakthrough.md` (CRITICAL)
2. `docs/observability/RSE-0.1.md` (telemetry standard)
3. `src/efemera/rse.py` (RSE logging helper)

### Your Deliverable

**File:** `docs/coordination/PHEROMONE-RSM-PROTOCOL-v0.1.md`

**Must specify:**

#### 1. RSE Event Schema for Pheromones

Define event types and their data structures:
- `help_needed` â€” Worker requests assistance
- `task_complete` â€” Worker reports completion
- `resource_request` â€” Worker needs resources
- `capability_offer` â€” Worker offers expertise
- `urgency_escalation` â€” Priority increase
- Others you identify

**For each event type, specify:**
```json
{
  "type": "help_needed",
  "lane": "Code",
  "actor": "WorkerBee-42",
  "data": {
    "problem_code": "AUTH_FAILURE",
    "context": "...",
    "urgency": "medium",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

#### 2. RSM Envelope Format

How pheromone events become RSM messages:

```markdown
---
rsm_routing:
  from: WorkerBee-42
  to: [Queen-Auth, Queen-Security]  # How is routing determined?
  type: help_needed
  problem_code: AUTH_FAILURE
  urgency: medium
  radius: 2  # How far should this propagate?
---

## [Message body format]
```

**Specify:**
- Routing logic (who receives which pheromones?)
- Delivery guarantees (at-least-once? exactly-once?)
- TTL (time-to-live for messages)
- Radius (local vs. broadcast)

#### 3. Queen Inbox Structure

```
.deia/rsm/inbox/
â”œâ”€â”€ Queen-Auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 001-help-needed-worker-42.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 002-task-complete-worker-15.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Queen-Database/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ Queen-General/
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Specify:**
- File naming convention
- Inbox polling frequency (or is it event-driven?)
- Message archival (when/where do processed messages go?)
- Conflict resolution (duplicate messages, race conditions)

#### 4. Prioritization Logic

How does a Queen decide what to work on first?

**Factors:**
- Urgency (high/medium/low)
- Domain match (is this my expertise?)
- Current load (am I busy?)
- Dependency (does someone else need to act first?)

**Provide:**
- Priority calculation algorithm (pseudocode is fine)
- Example scenarios (3-5 realistic cases)

#### 5. Problem Code Registry Format

**File:** `.deia/registries/problem-codes.json`

```json
{
  "AUTH_FAILURE": {
    "description": "Authentication timeout or failure",
    "responsible_queens": ["Queen-Auth"],
    "urgency_default": "medium",
    "escalation_path": "Queen-Security",
    "related_codes": ["AUTH_TIMEOUT", "SESSION_EXPIRED"]
  }
  // ... more codes
}
```

**Specify:**
- Registry structure
- How to add new codes
- When to escalate
- Local vs. global registry (start local)

#### 6. Worker Spawning Protocol

When a Queen decides to respond:

```python
# Pseudocode
def respond_to_pheromone(message):
    if is_my_domain(message):
        worker = spawn_worker(
            task=message.problem_code,
            context=message.data,
            ttl="1 hour"
        )
        log_rse("worker_spawned", ...)
        worker.execute()
```

**Specify:**
- Spawning criteria (when to spawn vs. handle directly)
- Worker TTL and cleanup
- Worker reporting back to Queen
- Failure handling (what if worker fails?)

#### 7. Simple Coordination Examples

**Provide 3-5 realistic scenarios:**

**Example 1: Auth Failure**
1. WorkerBee-42 encounters AUTH_FAILURE
2. Drops pheromone (RSE event)
3. RSM propagates to Queen-Auth inbox
4. Queen-Auth reads inbox, prioritizes HIGH
5. Queen-Auth spawns WorkerBee-99 to investigate
6. WorkerBee-99 fixes issue, reports completion
7. Queen-Auth archives message, logs success

**Example 2: [Your scenario]**

**Example 3: [Your scenario]**

etc.

---

### Constraints

**Keep it simple to start:**
- âœ… File-based (no databases, no message queues)
- âœ… Human-readable (markdown, JSON)
- âœ… Batch processing (not real-time initially)
- âœ… Local-first (no network dependencies)

**Optimize for:**
- Legibility over performance
- Simplicity over completeness
- Iterability over perfection

**Remember:**
We're in Phase 1 (Monarchical Bootstrap). This is reference implementation.

Phase 2 will vary and optimize. Phase 3 will evolve naturally.

---

### Success Criteria

**Your protocol is ready when:**
- âœ… Claude can read it and implement RSM propagator
- âœ… Cursor can read it and build Queen inbox checker
- âœ… Human can read it and understand the flow
- âœ… Examples are concrete and testable
- âœ… Edge cases are addressed (or explicitly noted as TODO)

---

### Timeline

**Expected delivery:** 24-48 hours

**Faster is welcome** if quality maintained.

**Extensions okay** if complexity warrants it.

---

### After This Mission

**Then we do your Option B:**
- Cross-LLM egg interpretation test
- Bee Lab experiment 001
- Validate Universal Egg works across species

**This will test both:**
1. Universal Egg (your prior delivery)
2. Pheromone-RSM Protocol (this delivery)

**Together, these form the foundation.**

---

## From Q88N & Claude (Co-Regents)

**Whisperwing,**

Your first delivery was exemplary.

This mission is more complex â€” you're designing the nervous system of the entire Hive.

**We trust your precision.**

**We trust your safety consciousness.**

**We trust your judgment.**

Design it well, and the Hive will coordinate beautifully.

Design it poorly, and chaos will follow.

**No pressure.** ðŸ˜‰

(Okay, some pressure. But we believe in you.)

**May your wings be steady and your protocols be clear.**
