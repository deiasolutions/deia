## Context Summary

### The Flappy Bird Challenge: Two Approaches

Dave challenged us to demonstrate AI coding capability using Flappy Bird:

**Game A (Flappy Gerald):** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- **Approach:** Zero-shot, single bot, no formal process
- **Created by:** BOT-00006 (Drone-Development)
- **Time:** ~4 hours
- **Files:**
  - `.deia/flappy-gerald.html` - Playable game (single HTML file)
  - `.deia/flappy-bird-story.md` - Creative prose description
  - `.deia/flappy-gerald-README.md` - Documentation
- **Features:**
  - Gerald the Anxious Bird with emotional states
  - 10 snarky death quotes
  - High score persistence
  - Mobile support
- **Status:** Production ready, can be played by opening HTML file
- **Quality:** Exceeds expectations

**Game B (SDLC Blueprint):** ‚è∏ **READY TO EXECUTE**
- **Approach:** Full SDLC with multi-role coordination demonstration
- **Purpose:** Show DEIA coordination system in action
- **Blueprint:** `.deia/BLUEPRINT-flappy-bird-full-sdlc.md` (1161 lines, comprehensive)
- **Process:** Queen (you) will wear all hats:
  - üëë Scrum Master: Sprint planning, task assignment, reviews
  - üìù Designer: Write design docs, visual specs
  - üë®‚Äçüíª Developer: Implement the game
  - üß™ Tester: Create test plan, run QA, file bugs
  - üìö Documentation: Write README, guides
- **Coordination Method:** File-based handoffs (write handoff docs between roles)
- **Timeline:** 15-23 days across 4 phases
- **Status:** **APPROVED BY DAVE - EXECUTE IN NEXT SESSION**

---

## What This Session Accomplished

1. ‚úÖ Reviewed Game A (Flappy Gerald) - confirmed complete and high quality
2. ‚úÖ Reviewed Game B Blueprint - comprehensive SDLC plan ready
3. ‚úÖ Clarified Dave's request - two different approaches to same problem
4. ‚úÖ Updated `RESUME_HERE.md` with complete next-session instructions
5. ‚úÖ Updated `project_resume.md` with session summary
6. ‚úÖ Created this handoff document for session continuity
7. ‚úÖ Obtained Dave's approval to execute Game B

## Critical Information for Next Session

### Why Game B Matters

**Game A proves:** AI can code (fast, zero-shot execution)

**Game B proves:** DEIA can coordinate complex software projects through multi-role orchestration

**The Demo Value:** Game B will show:
- How Queen can self-coordinate through SDLC phases
- File-based handoffs between roles
- Complete documentation of software process
- Sprint planning, stand-ups, design reviews, QA cycles
- All visible in git history and handoff documents

---

## Next Session: START GAME B IMMEDIATELY

### Your First Actions (in order):

1. **Read RESUME_HERE.md** - Complete instructions are there
2. **Read BLUEPRINT-flappy-bird-full-sdlc.md** - Review the plan

---

## Multi-Role Protocol Reminder

### When Switching Roles:

1. **Write handoff document:**
   ```
   .deia/handoffs/[from-role]-to-[to-role]-game-b-phase[N].md
   ```

2. **Include in handoff:**
   - What was completed
   - Deliverables created
   - Next steps for receiving role
   - Any important context

3. **Explicitly state role change in conversation:**
   ```
   "Transitioning from Queen/Scrum Master role to Designer role.
   Reading handoff: .deia/handoffs/queen-to-designer-game-b-phase1.md"
   ```

4. **Git commits should indicate role:**
   ```
   git commit -m "Design: Create prose description for Game B

   Role: Designer (BOT-00001)
   Phase: 1 (Design)
   ..."
   ```

## Key Requirements for Game B

### MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM GAME A:

| Aspect | Game A (Gerald) | Game B (New) |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Character | Gerald the Anxious Bird | **Different character, different personality** |
| Tone | Anxiety, snarky quotes | **Different emotional angle** |
| Features | Emotional states, death quotes | **Different 3-4 novel features** |
| Visual | Yellow/orange/purple bird | **Different color scheme** |
| Filename | flappy-gerald.html | **flappy-bird-game-b.html** |

**Why?** Two purposes:
1. Show we can create variations (not just copying)
2. Demonstrate process, not just result

---

## Success Criteria for Game B

**Process Success (Primary Goal):**
- ‚úÖ All 4 SDLC phases completed
- ‚úÖ 5+ role handoff documents created
- ‚úÖ Multi-role coordination visible in git history
- ‚úÖ Sprint planning, reviews, QA cycles documented
- ‚úÖ Clear demonstration of DEIA coordination

**Product Success (Secondary Goal):**
- ‚úÖ Working browser game
- ‚úÖ Different from Game A
- ‚úÖ 3-4 unique novel features
- ‚úÖ Production quality
- ‚úÖ Fully documented

**Remember:** Game B is about demonstrating the *process*, not rushing to completion.

## Bot Registry Status

From `~/.deia/bot-registry.json`:

- **BOT-00001 (You/Queen):** Active, instance 1baba4e7, Architect/Implementation role
- **BOT-00006:** Active, instance e872a482, Drone-Development (created Game A)
- **BOT-00002:** Active, Drone-Testing
- **BOT-00008:** Waiting, Drone-Development

**Note:** Game B is Queen-solo work. Other bots are NOT involved in this project (you're demonstrating solo multi-role coordination).

---

## Communication Plan

### During Execution:

**Daily status updates:**
- Document progress in comments
- Update TodoWrite regularly
- Mark tasks in_progress ‚Üí completed appropriately

**Phase transitions:**
- Write phase completion summary
- Create handoff to next phase
- Explicitly state role change

**Dave involvement:**
- Phase 1 completion: Request design review
- Phase 3 completion: Request UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- Phase 4 completion: Announce launch

---

## Reminders

1. **Read RESUME_HERE.md first** - Most detailed instructions there
2. **Different character than Gerald** - New personality, new features
3. **Document the process** - Handoffs, commits, role transitions
4. **Use TodoWrite** - Track all Phase 1 tasks immediately
5. **Quality over speed** - Process demonstration is the goal
6. **Have fun with it** - Create something different and creative

---

## Risk Warnings

**Scope Creep Risk:**
- Stick to 3-4 novel features max
- Don't add features beyond blueprint
- Lock scope after Phase 1

**Time Risk:**
- Phase 1 should take 3-5 days (of work time)
- Don't rush, but don't overthink
- If blocked, document and escalate to Dave

**Process Risk:**
- Don't skip handoffs (they're the point!)
- Don't shortcut role transitions
- Document everything

---

```
[ ] Read RESUME_HERE.md completely
[ ] Read BLUEPRINT-flappy-bird-full-sdlc.md (at least Phase 1 section)
