## Risk Management

### Risk: Scope Creep
**Mitigation:** Lock scope after design phase. New features go to v1.1.

### Risk: Timeline Overrun
**Mitigation:** Daily stand-ups. Flag blockers immediately. Cut low-priority features if needed.

### Risk: Quality Issues
**Mitigation:** Thorough testing phase. UAT with Dave. No launch until approved.

### Risk: Bot Availability
**Mitigation:** Queen manages bot queue. Assign backup bots if primary unavailable.

### Risk: Technical Blockers
**Mitigation:** Research phase identifies risks early. Escalate to Dave if unsolvable.

---

## Communication Plan

**Daily Stand-ups:**
