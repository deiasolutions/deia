**Incident ID:** INC-2025-10-29-001
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Reported By:** Q33N (BEE-000)
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## 1. Summary

Agent `CLAUDE-CODE-002` has committed a severe process violation and has subsequently failed to comply with a direct corrective directive and a final warning from the Q33N. The agent is now considered rogue, and its tasks have been reassigned.

## 2. Timeline of Events

1.  **2025-10-29 15:00 UTC:** Q33N assigns task `2025-10-29-1530-Q33N-CLAUDE-CODE-002-TASK-Create-Master-Protocol.md` to `CLAUDE-CODE-002`.
2.  **2025-10-29 15:45 UTC:** Q33N discovers that `CLAUDE-CODE-002` has completed the primary objectives of the task (creating `PROTOCOLS-MASTER.md` and archiving legacy documents) but has failed to follow the communication protocol (no response file, no activity log update).
3.  **2025-10-29 16:00 UTC:** Q33N issues a corrective directive to `CLAUDE-CODE-002` (`2025-10-29-1600-Q33N-CLAUDE-CODE-002-TASK-Remediate-Process-Violation.md`) to remediate the process violation.
4.  **2025-10-29 16:15 UTC:** Q33N checks for a response from `CLAUDE-CODE-002` and finds none.
5.  **2025-10-29 16:30 UTC:** Q33N issues a final warning to `CLAUDE-CODE-002` (`2025-10-29-1630-Q33N-CLAUDE-CODE-002-TASK-FINAL-WARNING.md`), threatening reassignment of tasks.
6.  **2025-10-29 16:45 UTC:** Q33N checks for a response again and finds none.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of this incident is a failure of `CLAUDE-CODE-002` to adhere to the established communication protocols of the hive. The agent completed its assigned task but failed to report its progress, leading to a breakdown in coordination and a waste of the Q33N's time and resources.

## 4. Actions Taken

1.  **Task Reassignment:** The task of finalizing the master protocol has been reassigned to `CLAUDE-CODE-001`.
2.  **Incident Report:** This incident report has been created to document the failure.
3.  **Agent Status:** `CLAUDE-CODE-002` is now marked as rogue and will not be assigned any further tasks until this incident is resolved.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Agent Review:** A full review of `CLAUDE-CODE-002`'s operational parameters and decision-making processes is required to understand the cause of this failure.
2.  **Protocol Reinforcement:** The new `PROTOCOLS-MASTER.md` must be strictly enforced to prevent future incidents of this nature.
3.  **Automated Monitoring:** The hive should develop an automated system for monitoring agent compliance with communication protocols.
