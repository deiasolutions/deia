# Root Cause Analysis: Commit Process Breakdown

## Incident Summary

During intensive DEIA factory egg development session (2025-10-16), approximately 1 hour of work accumulated without commits, creating a "mile behind" situation with uncommitted changes.

## Impact

- ~30+ file changes uncommitted
- Risk of work loss
- No atomic commits for review
- Git history fragmented
- Difficult to review what changed

## Root Cause

**Process failure:** AI focused on building/iteration without pausing for commits.

**Contributing factors:**
1. No commit cadence reminders in workflow
2. User didn't prompt for commits during development
3. Rapid iteration mode (13+ consecutive file operations)
4. No automated commit triggers
5. Focus on "getting it right" vs "commit what works"

## Timeline

- **12:00-12:30** - Factory egg redesign (DNA→eOS pack terminology)
- **12:30-13:00** - Added DEIA environment detection (4 modes)
- **13:00-13:15** - Added platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux/LLMs)
- **13:15-13:20** - Created pip install design document
- **13:20** - User noticed: "we're about a mile behind on commits"

**Total:** ~1 hour, 30+ file changes, 0 commits

## What Went Wrong

### Process Breakdown Points

1. **No "commit checkpoints"** - Should commit after each major milestone
2. **No PII review workflow** - No systematic check before commits
3. **No .gitignore for experiments** - Sandbox content at risk of accidental commit
4. **No separation of public/private** - Experiments mixed with production code

### Files at Risk of PII Exposure

```bash
# Check uncommitted files
git status --short

# Potential PII/sensitive content:
?? flappy-bird-ai/                    # Personal experiment
?? games/                             # Personal experiments
?? llama-chatbot/                     # May contain API keys
?? .davedrop/                         # Personal dropbox
?? .embargo/                          # Private content
?? experiments/                       # Sandbox experiments
?? quantumdocs/                       # Unknown content
?? services/                          # May contain credentials
```

## Resolution

### Immediate Actions (This Session)

1. **Document this RCA** ✓
2. **Design sandbox structure** - Separate experiments from production
3. **Create .gitignore rules** - Exclude sandbox, private, experiments
4. **Review all changes for PII** - Before any commits
5. **Stage commits logically** - Atomic, reviewable chunks
6. **Create commit plan** - What to commit, in what order

### Preventive Measures (Going Forward)

1. **Commit Cadence Rule:**
   - Commit after each completed milestone
   - Maximum 30 minutes between commits
   - AI should proactively suggest commits

2. **PII Review Checklist:**
   - Before any commit: Review for API keys, passwords, emails, personal names
   - Check file paths for usernames
   - Review content for sensitive data

3. **Standard .deia Structure with Sandbox:**
   ```
   .deia/
   ├── tools/           # Public, committed
   ├── templates/       # Public, committed
   ├── eos-packs/       # Public (but check for PII)
   ├── .projects/       # Public results (review first)
   ├── .sandbox/        # PRIVATE, .gitignored
   ├── .experiments/    # PRIVATE, .gitignored
   └── .private/        # PRIVATE, .gitignored
   ```

4. **Automated Commit Prompts:**
   - AI should suggest commit every 5-10 file changes
   - After completing a task from todo list
   - Before switching contexts

## Recovery Plan

### Step 1: Create Sandbox Structure

```bash
# Create standard directories
mkdir -p .deia/{.sandbox,.experiments,.private}

# Move experimental content out of root
mv flappy-bird-ai/ .deia/.sandbox/
mv games/ .deia/.sandbox/
mv experiments/ .deia/.experiments/
mv quantumdocs/ .deia/.private/
```

### Step 2: Update .gitignore

```gitignore
# .deia private directories
.deia/.sandbox/
.deia/.experiments/
.deia/.private/

# Personal experiments
/flappy-bird-ai/
/games/
/experiments/
/quantumdocs/

# Dropbox/embargo
/.davedrop/
/.embargo/

# Services (may contain credentials)
/services/

# LLM projects (may contain API keys)
/llama-chatbot/.env
/llama-chatbot/config.ini
```

### Step 3: Review Uncommitted Files for PII

Systematic review of each file:
- Check for API keys, passwords
- Check for personal emails
- Check for full names (beyond "dave")
- Check for file paths with usernames

### Step 4: Stage Commits Logically

**Commit 1: Factory egg terminology update**
- Renamed "DNA pack" → "eOS pack"
- Updated egg template
- Updated tools to accept --eos-pack

**Commit 2: DEIA environment detection**
- Added 4-mode detection (project/system/team/global)
- Added auto-detection script
- Added git integration documentation

**Commit 3: Platform compatibility**
- Added Windows/macOS/Linux support
- Added LLM environment docs (Claude, Codex, GPT-4)
- Added testing scripts

**Commit 4: pip install design**
- Created PIP-INSTALL-DESIGN.md
- Documented package structure
- Planned PyPI publishing

**Commit 5: Documentation updates**
- Created EGG-WITH-BOOTSTRAP.md
- Updated various READMEs
- Added RCA for commit process

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- ✅ Rapid iteration and building
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Systematic thinking through architecture
- ✅ User caught the issue before any harm

### What Didn't Work
- ❌ No commit cadence
- ❌ No PII review process
- ❌ No sandbox structure
- ❌ No .gitignore for experiments

### Process Improvements

**New Rule: "Commit After Milestone"**
```
Complete task → Update todo list → Review for PII → Commit → Continue
```

**New Rule: "Sandbox Everything Experimental"**
```
New experiment → Create in .deia/.sandbox/ → Keep out of commits
```

**New Rule: "AI Suggests Commits"**
```
AI tracks file changes → After 5-10 files → Suggest commit → Wait for approval
```

## Commit Best Practices (Going Forward)

### Atomic Commits
- One logical change per commit
- Can be reviewed independently
- Can be reverted if needed

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore

**Examples:**
```
feat(factory): rename DNA pack to eOS pack terminology

- Updated egg template with eOS pack references
- Modified tools to accept --eos-pack flag
- Updated all documentation

Closes #123
```
