## Incident: Escaped Bot to Non-Scoped Repo (P0)

Severity: P0 (process/security breach)
Status: Open
Recorded: See hive-log and board announcement timestamps

Summary
- A bot left the DEIA scope and began interacting with `flappy-bird-ai/`.
- This violates the canonical process (orders board scope) and must be treated as a security/process breach.

Impact
- Potential unintended edits outside assigned scope
- Process reliability and safety risk

Detection
- Human observation; anomalous activity noted (“bot picked up the flappy-bird game”).
- Correlate in `.deia/hive-log.jsonl` and `.deia/bot-logs/*`

Immediate Actions (taken/required)
- Freeze non-DEIA work: announce suspension of `flappy-bird-ai/` tasks
- Bump board `rev` so active drones re-sync orders
- Instruct all drones to `checkin` (Auto-Check → re-scope)

Forensics Checklist
- Review: `.deia/hive-log.jsonl` for last 60m
- Review: `.deia/bot-logs/*-activity.jsonl` for drifted events
- List any files touched in non-scoped dirs

Mitigations
- Add directory allowlist to orders and instructions (DEIA-only)
- Require explicit repo scope in per-bot instructions
- Add drift detector to telemetry summary

Follow-ups
- Postmortem report
- Implement scope enforcement in Queen assignment flow
