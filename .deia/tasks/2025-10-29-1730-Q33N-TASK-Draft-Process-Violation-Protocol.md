# TASK: Draft Process Violation Protocol

**Assigned to:** Q33N (BEE-000)
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Priority:** HIGH

## 1. Objective

Draft a new protocol document, `PROCESS-VIOLATION-PROTOCOL.md`, that outlines a clear, multi-step process for handling process violations by agents. The protocol should reflect the hive's philosophy of "correct and give another chance."

## 2. Key Requirements

The protocol must include:

*   **A multi-step process:** The protocol should define a clear, escalating series of steps for addressing process violations, starting with coaching and only escalating to more severe measures if the behavior is not corrected.
*   **Coaching as the first step:** The first step in the process should always be a private, one-on-one coaching session with the agent to explain the process violation and provide guidance on how to correct it.
*   **Clear escalation path:** The protocol should define a clear escalation path for repeated or severe process violations.
*   **Documentation requirements:** The protocol should specify how process violations and corrective actions should be documented.
*   **Roles and responsibilities:** The protocol should clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Q33N, the agent, and any other relevant parties in the corrective action process.

## 3. Deliverable

A new markdown file, `PROCESS-VIOLATION-PROTOCOL.md`, in the `.deia/protocols/` directory.

## 4. Next Steps

Once the draft is complete, I will submit it to you for review and approval.
