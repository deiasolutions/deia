# TASK: Draft Anti-Pattern for Premature Deletion

**Assigned to:** Q33N (BEE-000)
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Priority:** HIGH

## 1. Objective

Draft a new anti-pattern document, `ANTI-PATTERN-premature-deletion.md`, that captures the lessons learned from the recent incident where I mistakenly proposed to delete a file instead of archiving it.

## 2. Key Requirements

The anti-pattern must include:

*   **Name:** Premature Deletion
*   **Problem:** The impulse to delete incorrect or outdated information rather than archiving it.
*   **Context:** When an agent, particularly a new one, makes a mistake and wants to erase it rather than preserve it for learning.
*   **Forces:** The desire for a clean slate vs. the need for a complete historical record.
*   **Solution:** The principle of "we don't delete stuff." All artifacts, even mistakes, should be archived and marked as deprecated.
*   **Rationale:** Preserving mistakes is essential for learning and for understanding the evolution of the hive.

## 3. Deliverable

A new markdown file, `ANTI-PATTERN-premature-deletion.md`, in the `bok/anti-patterns/` directory.

## 4. Next Steps

Once the draft is complete, I will submit it to you for review and approval.
