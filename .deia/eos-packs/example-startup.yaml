  Example startup organization with:
  - Founders (executive LLH)
  - Engineering team (functional LLH)
  - Product team (functional LLH)
  - Two cross-functional TAGs (MVP launch, customer beta)

  This demonstrates hierarchical LLHs (founders â†’ eng/product)
  and TAG teams that span multiple LLHs.
