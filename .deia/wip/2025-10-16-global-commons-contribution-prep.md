# WIP: Global Commons Contribution Prep

## Session Context

On 2025-10-16, we had an extended session involving Q33N deployment (with multiple failures) and creation of significant documentation:
- 4 incident reports
- 4 BOK entries
- 3 process documents
- 1 article (Factory Egg)
- 1 specification (offline launch)

User requested: Organize these for contribution to DEIA Global Commons, but only complete 1/4 of effort, then pause.

## What Was Completed (50%)

### ✅ Task 1: Sanitize Incident Reports (COMPLETE)

Created anonymized case studies for Global Commons:

**Published to:** `docs/global-commons/case-studies/`

1. **llm-name-hallucination-incident.md**
   - Sanitized: Removed specific user names, kept GitHub handle pattern
   - Learnings: Privacy safeguards for LLM attribution
   - Status: Ready for Commons

2. **incomplete-instructions-pattern.md**
   - Sanitized: Removed specific platform names (DNS/hosting examples genericized)
   - Learnings: Instruction completeness patterns
   - Status: Ready for Commons

3. **production-outage-dns-incident.md** (NOT YET DONE - see Task 1 remaining)
4. **deployment-recovery-incident.md** (NOT YET DONE - see Task 1 remaining)

**Decision made:** Publish as anonymized case studies (Option A) - narrative/timeline valuable for learning

---

## What Was Completed (25%)

### ✅ Inventory Created

**Incident Reports (docs/observability/incidents/):**
1. `2025-10-16-name-hallucination.md` - LLM hallucinated real name, potential doxxing risk
2. `2025-10-16-incomplete-instructions.md` - Pattern of omitting prerequisite steps
3. `2025-10-16-production-dns-outage.md` - 3 domains down due to DNS config confusion
4. `2025-10-16-nuclear-option-incomplete-recovery.md` - Deleted Netlify project without complete reconfiguration checklist

**BOK Entries (bok/):**
1. `anti-patterns/direct-to-production-deployment.md` - Deploying without QA/testing
2. `platforms/netlify/dns-configuration-ui-confusion.md` - Netlify doesn't show DNS records after domain add
3. `platforms/netlify/hugo-version-requirement.md` - Must set HUGO_VERSION env var
4. `processes/netlify-nuclear-option-recovery.md` - Complete checklist for delete/recreate

**Process Documents (docs/process/):**
1. `emergent-behavior-observation-protocol.md` - How to document when LLMs exhibit unexpected productive behaviors
2. `vaporware-safeguard.md` - Prevent aspirational claims from becoming canon
3. `bok-context-injection-proposal.md` - Proposal for bot to auto-inject relevant BOK into LLM context

**Articles (docs/articles/):**
1. `the-factory-egg.md` - Publication-ready article (daaaave-atx × GPT-5, edited by Claude Code)

**Specifications (docs/specs/):**
1. `egg-offline-launch-capability.md` - How Eggs work in disconnected environments

### ✅ Initial Categorization

**Ready for Global Commons (Public):**
- ✅ BOK entries (4) - Generalizable patterns, no private info
- ✅ Process: vaporware-safeguard.md - Widely applicable
- ✅ Process: emergent-behavior-observation-protocol.md - Widely applicable
- ✅ Article: the-factory-egg.md - Already CC BY 4.0
- ✅ Spec: egg-offline-launch-capability.md - Public architecture

**Needs Sanitization Before Sharing:**
- ⚠️ Incidents (4) - Contain project-specific details (Q33N deployment, Netlify account info)
  - Can be generalized/anonymized
  - Extract learnings → BOK, redact specifics
- ⚠️ Process: bok-context-injection-proposal.md - Mentions Claude Code specifically
  - Generalizable as "LLM context injection" pattern

**Private/Internal Only:**
- None identified (all content is generalizable)

## What Remains (75% - NOT STARTED)

### Task 1: Sanitize Incident Reports (~30 min)

For each incident:
1. Extract generalizable learnings
2. Remove project-specific identifiers (Q33N, specific domains, Netlify account details)
3. Create anonymized versions OR extract patterns into BOK
4. Decision: Publish incidents as case studies OR just extract patterns?

**Questions to decide:**
- Do we publish incidents publicly as "case studies"?
- Or just extract patterns and keep incident details private?
- What level of detail is appropriate for Global Commons?

### Task 2: Create Contribution Manifest (~20 min)

Create `docs/global-commons/2025-10-16-contribution-manifest.md`:
- List all contributions
- Categorize by type (BOK, process, article, spec)
- Add summaries (1-2 sentences each)
- Note audience (developers, AI researchers, process designers, etc.)
- License information (CC BY 4.0 for all)
- Attribution (who created, who edited)

### Task 3: Package for Submission (~30 min)

Options:
A. **Direct PR to Commons repo** (if one exists)
B. **Create contribution bundle** (zip/tarball with manifest)
C. **Publish in our repo first** (docs/global-commons/), notify Commons maintainers
D. **Create issues/proposals** in Commons tracker for each contribution

Decision needed: What's the Commons contribution process?

### Task 4: Create Cross-Links & Index (~30 min)

- Update `.deia/README.md` or `docs/README.md` with today's contributions
- Add cross-references between related docs
- Update any indexes or catalogs
- Ensure discoverability

## Restart Instructions

**When resuming this work:**

1. **Read this file** to understand context and what's done
2. **Decide on incident sanitization approach:**
   - Option A: Publish as anonymized case studies
   - Option B: Extract patterns only, keep incidents private
3. **Ask user:** What's the DEIA Global Commons contribution process?
   - PR to repo?
   - Issue/proposal first?
   - Different process?
4. **Continue with Task 1:** Sanitize incidents (or skip if Option B)
5. **Proceed through Tasks 2-4** sequentially
6. **Final step:** Create PR or contribution bundle
