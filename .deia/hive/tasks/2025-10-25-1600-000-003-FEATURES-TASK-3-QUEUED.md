## Feature 3: Custom Commands (1.5 hours)

**What it is:**
Users define custom commands that chain bot operations together.

**What to build:**
- Command builder: `POST /api/commands` - define custom command
- Command format: `command_name` → executes sequence of bots/actions
- Variables: Support variables like {user_input}, {timestamp}, {bot_response}
- Examples:
  - `/analyze-project` → BOT-001 scans code → BOT-003 summarizes
  - `/quick-review` → BOT-001 checks errors → reports results
- Storage: `.deia/user-commands.jsonl`
- Execution: `POST /api/commands/{name}/execute` - run custom command

**Implementation:**
- Parse command definition
- Execute sequence of bots
- Pass variables between steps
- Return final result

**Success criteria:**
- Commands create and save ✓
- Command execution works ✓
- Variables interpolate correctly ✓
- Multi-step execution works ✓
- 70%+ test coverage ✓

**Time estimate:** 1.5 hours
