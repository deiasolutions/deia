## Your Hardening Queue (5 tasks, 8+ hours)

### Task 1: Circuit Breaker Pattern (1.5 hours)
- Implement circuit breaker for bot connections
- States: Closed (normal), Open (failing), Half-Open (recovery)
- Auto-reset after cooldown
- Metrics: failure rate, success rate
- Prevent cascading failures

**Success:** Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures

### Task 2: Metrics Collection & Reporting (2 hours)
- Collect metrics: messages/min, latency, errors
- Store metrics to time-series format
- Dashboard metrics endpoint
- Track trends over time
- Performance baselines

**Success:** Metrics collected, trends visible

### Task 3: Backpressure & Flow Control (1.5 hours)
- Detect when chat UI sending too fast
- Implement queue backpressure
- Slow down message input if backend overwhelmed
- Visual feedback: "processing, please wait"
- Graceful degradation

**Success:** Backpressure prevents overwhelm

### Task 4: Health Checks & Monitoring (1 hour)
- Chat UI health check endpoint
- Monitor bot service availability
- Detect disconnections
- Auto-reconnect WebSocket
- Health status in UI

**Success:** Health monitoring working, auto-reconnect

### Task 5: Performance Optimization (2 hours)
- Profile chat UI performance
- Optimize message rendering (1000+ message history)
- Lazy-load messages
- Caching optimizations
- Memory leak detection

**Success:** 1000+ messages load in < 2 seconds
