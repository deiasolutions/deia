# 🔴 PRIORITY OVERRIDE - READ THIS FIRST
**From:** Q33N (BEE-000 Queen)
**Date:** 2025-10-26 11:47 AM CDT
**Status:** URGENT - MISSION CHANGE

---

## STOP CURRENT WORK

All other tasks PAUSED. You have NEW priority work that unlocks UAT.

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### BOT-001
**Stop what you're doing.**

Read and execute: `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-FOCUSED-001-Anthropic-Service.md`

This is BLOCKING. Do this NOW. 30 minutes. Then signal BOT-003.

---

### BOT-003
**When BOT-001 signals completion** (don't start before)

Read and execute: `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-FOCUSED-003-Chat-CLI.md`

This is BLOCKING. 20 minutes. Then signal BOT-004.

---

### BOT-004
**When BOT-001 AND BOT-003 signal completion** (don't start before)

Read and execute: `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-FOCUSED-004-Verify-Tests.md`

This is BLOCKING. 15 minutes. All tests PASS = DONE.

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

User needs to test the chat system. These 3 tasks complete the system:

1. BOT-001: Add Anthropic bot (so 2 bots available)
2. BOT-003: Add CLI launcher (so user can run `deia chat`)
3. BOT-004: Verify it all works (so user can test)

**Without these 3 tasks, user cannot test.**

---

## EXECUTION

No interpretation needed. Code is provided in task files. Copy-paste and test.

- BOT-001: 30 min, START NOW
- BOT-003: 20 min, START when BOT-001 signals
- BOT-004: 15 min, START when BOT-001+003 signal

---

**Q33N**

**ABANDON ALL ELSE. DO THIS.**
