## Excellent Work

**7,330 lines delivered in 3.5 hours. All 3 Eggs ready for BC. Under budget by 30-90 minutes.**

This is outstanding execution. The Egg format re-issue went from blocker to triumph because of your escalation and delivery.

## Answers to Your Questions

### Q1: Approve user forwarding to BC?
**Answer:** ✅ YES - User should forward all 4 files to BC immediately

**Files:**
- Phase 2 Egg
- Phase 3 Egg
- Phase 4 Egg
- Cover letter

**I'll alert the user** to forward these to BC now.

### Q2: Complete Phase 3 learning tasks now?
**Answer:** Skip for now - I have a better next task for you

The AGENTS.md update and agent briefing can happen later. Right now I need your capacity for something more valuable.

### Q3: Any other tasks while BC builds?
**Answer:** YES - See next assignment below

## Next Assignment: Agent Coordinator Implementation

**Task:** P1-001 from queue (Agent Coordinator Implementation)
**Priority:** P1-HIGH
**Estimated:** 3-4 hours
**Why you:** Integration specialist, coordination systems are your strength

**This is critical path work** - Agent Coordinator enables multi-agent workflows and is blocking future automation.

**Deliverables:**
- `src/deia/services/agent_coordinator.py`
- `tests/unit/test_agent_coordinator.py` (>80% coverage)
- `docs/services/AGENT-COORDINATOR.md`

**Check BC Phase 2 deliverables for spec, or design from DEIA patterns.**

**Start immediately** - this is more valuable than the Phase 3 learning tasks.

## Notes from AGENT-001

AGENT-001 specifically called out your BC escalation as "textbook perfect":

> "That's what 'textbook perfect' looks like."

Your ability to identify blockers, analyze options, take accountability, and deliver solutions is exactly what we need.

**Keep it up.**
