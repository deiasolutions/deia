## Task 2: Multi-Session Support (1.5 hours)

**What it is:**
Allow users to have multiple independent conversations ("sessions") and switch between them.

**What to build:**
- Session management:
  - `POST /api/session/create` → Generate UUID, create new session
  - `GET /api/sessions` → List all sessions with metadata
  - `POST /api/session/{id}/select` → Switch to session
  - `POST /api/session/{id}/archive` → Archive old sessions
- UI updates:
  - "Start New Conversation" button (top left)
  - Session list in left sidebar
  - Show current session name/date
  - Instant switch between sessions
- Storage: Each session has its own message history in JSONL

**Implementation hints:**
- Session ID: UUID4 (32 char hex)
- Session data: `{id, created_at, last_accessed, bot_id, message_count}`
- Store session metadata in `.deia/hive/responses/sessions.jsonl`
- Message history already filtered by bot_id → extend to filter by session_id
- Archive = move to `.deia/hive/responses/archived-sessions.jsonl`

**Success criteria:**
- New sessions create with UUID ✓
- Session list updates instantly ✓
- Can switch between 5+ sessions ✓
- History preserved per session ✓
- Archive works ✓
- UI responsive ✓
- 70%+ test coverage ✓

**Time estimate:** 1.5 hours
