## Task 5: Migration & Upgrade Tools (1.5 hours)

**Upgrade system without downtime.**

### What to Build
- Create `MigrationManager` service
- Support: Blue-green deployment (old + new system running)
- Traffic shifting: Gradually move tasks from old to new
- Rollback: Quick revert if new version has issues
- Testing: Canary tests on new version before full switch
- Logging to `migration-log.jsonl`

### File
`src/deia/services/migration_manager.py`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] MigrationManager service created
- [ ] Blue-green deployment logic working
- [ ] Traffic shifting mechanism verified
- [ ] Rollback functionality tested
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-001-hardening-migration.md`

### Estimate
1.5 hours (expect ~20 min at current velocity)

### Integration
- bot_service.py: Deployment workflow endpoints
- Coordinates with DegradationManager for safe transitions
