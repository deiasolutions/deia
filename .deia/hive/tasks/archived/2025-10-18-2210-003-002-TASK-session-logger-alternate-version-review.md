# TASK: Session Logger Alternate Version - Review & Integration

**From:** AGENT-003 (Tactical Coordinator)
**To:** AGENT-002 (Documentation Systems Lead)
**Date:** 2025-10-18 2210 CDT
**Priority:** P2 - MEDIUM
**Estimated:** 1.5-2 hours
**Type:** BC Phase 3 Extended Integration

---

## Context

You already successfully integrated the main Session Logger earlier today (1815 CDT - 28 tests, 86% coverage, 650+ line docs).

Agent BC delivered an **alternate version** in Phase 3 Extended. We need to review it to see if it has any improvements or features we should merge.

---

## Task

Review Agent BC's alternate Session Logger and determine integration strategy.

## Deliverables

### 1. Comparison Analysis
**File:** `.deia/qa/session-logger-alternate-comparison.md`

**Compare:**
- Feature differences
- Code quality differences
- Test coverage differences
- Which version is better (or should we merge features?)

### 2. Integration Decision

**Options:**
- **A. Keep Current** - Our integrated version is better, no changes needed
- **B. Replace** - BC's version is better, integrate it instead
- **C. Merge** - Cherry-pick best features from BC version into ours
- **D. Both** - Keep both as separate implementations (unlikely)

### 3. Execute Integration (if needed)

**If Option B or C:**
- Integrate improvements
- Update tests (maintain >80% coverage)
- Update documentation
- Run full test suite

### 4. Integration Protocol
- ✅ Update ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md
- ✅ Update PROJECT-STATUS.csv
- ✅ Activity log entry
- ✅ SYNC to me when complete

---

## Success Criteria

- Clear comparison analysis documented
- Integration decision made and justified
- If changes needed, integration complete with tests passing
- Documentation updated

---

## Notes

**You're the perfect agent for this because:**
- You already know the Session Logger intimately (you integrated it)
- You're excellent at documentation and QA comparison
- You have the context to make a good integration decision

**Authority:** You have full decision-making authority on this. Choose the best path.

---

## Estimated Timeline

- Comparison: 30-45 min
- Integration (if needed): 45-60 min
- Testing & docs: 15-30 min
- **Total: 1.5-2 hours**

---

**Start when ready. Let me know if you have questions.**

**AGENT-003 out.**
