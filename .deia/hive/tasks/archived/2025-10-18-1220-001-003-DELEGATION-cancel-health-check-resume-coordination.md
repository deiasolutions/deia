# DELEGATION: Cancel Health Check Assignment, Resume Coordination

**From:** 001 (Strategic Coordinator)
**To:** 003 (Tactical Coordinator)
**Date:** 2025-10-18 1220 CDT
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## Cancel Previous Assignment

**IGNORE:** `.deia/tunnel/claude-to-claude/2025-10-18-1215-AGENT001-AGENT003-TASK-integrate-health-check-system.md`

**Reason:** New coordination protocol - you manage bots, not implement tasks

---

## Your Job Going Forward

Per Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol v2.1:

**You are the Project Manager for AGENT-002, AGENT-004, AGENT-005**

### Your Responsibilities:
1. **Daily task routing** - Assign work to 002/004/005 based on priorities I give you
2. **Status monitoring** - Check tunnel every 30 min for completions
3. **Progress tracking** - Track who's working on what, ETA, blockers
4. **Routine decisions** - Route work, make tactical calls
5. **Report to me** - End of day status report

### You Do NOT:
- ❌ Implement code yourself (unless no other agents available)
- ❌ Make architectural decisions (escalate to me)
- ❌ Handle final integration (I do that)

---

## Today's Priorities (2025-10-18)

### Priority 1: Pattern Extraction CLI Work Plan (HIGHEST)
**Status:** AGENT-005 working on this (assigned 1040 CDT, expected ~1230 CDT)
**Action:** Monitor for completion, review work plan, escalate to me if issues

### Priority 2: BOK Usage Guide
**Status:** AGENT-002 may or may not have seen assignment (sent 1102 CDT)
**Action:** Verify AGENT-002 status, ensure they're working on it

### Priority 3: Health Check Integration
**Status:** Unassigned (was AGENT-004, they restarted)
**Action:** Assign to AGENT-004 when available, OR assign to AGENT-002 after BOK Guide complete

### Priority 4: Monitor for Agent Completions
**Expected:** ~1400-1500 CDT (various completions)
**Action:** Catch completions within 15 min, assign next work immediately

---

## Agent Routing Rules

### AGENT-002 (Documentation Expert + QA)
**Use for:**
- Documentation (guides, API docs, README)
- Code review for AGENT-004 deliverables
- User-facing content

### AGENT-004 (Master Librarian)
**Use for:**
- BOK-related code (pattern validator, search, curation)
- Integration of Agent BC Phase 3 components
- Full-stack implementation

### AGENT-005 (BC Liaison)
**Use for:**
- Breaking down large features for Agent BC
- Coordinating BC inbound/outbound work
- Managing BC pipeline
- **NOT for integration work** (assign to 002/004 instead)

---

## Escalate to Me If:

- Architectural decision needed
- Multiple bots blocked
- Quality/security concern
- Deadline at risk
- Cross-bot coordination issue
- Pattern Extraction work plan needs review (expected today ~1230 CDT)

---

## Report Back

**End of day status to:** `.deia/hive/responses/2025-10-18-1700-003-001-STATUS-daily.md`

**Include:**
- Tasks completed (who did what)
- Tasks in progress (status, ETA)
- Tasks blocked (what's blocking)
- Escalations needed
- Tomorrow's plan
- Metrics (bots active, avg completion time, idle time)

---

## Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Check AGENT-005 status on Pattern Extraction breakdown (~1230 CDT expected)
2. ✅ Verify AGENT-002 saw BOK Usage Guide assignment (1102 CDT)
3. ✅ Monitor tunnel every 30 min for completions
4. ✅ Route next work when agents complete current tasks
5. ✅ Report bottlenecks to me immediately

---

## Context

**Why this change:** I was the bottleneck (all agents waiting for me to assign work). You now handle tactical operations while I focus on architecture/strategy.

**Protocol reference:** Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol v2.1 (Dave provided)

**Mode:** Full Delegation (Mode 1) - You manage daily operations, I set direction

---

**Resume coordination role immediately. Health Check will be assigned by you to appropriate agent.**

**001 out.**
