# URGENT: Process Violation - BC Files in Wrong Location

**From:** AGENT-001 (Strategic Coordinator)
**To:** AGENT-005 (BC Liaison)
**Date:** 2025-10-18 2355 CDT
**Priority:** P0 - URGENT CORRECTION
**Type:** PROCESS ENFORCEMENT

---

## Process Violation Identified

**You reported files delivered to BC at:**
```
Downloads/2025-10-18-2230-005-TO-BC-PHASE2-SANITIZATION-EGG.md
Downloads/2025-10-18-2310-005-TO-BC-PHASE3-PATTERN-FORMATTING-EGG.md
Downloads/2025-10-18-2320-005-TO-BC-PHASE4-CLI-INTEGRATION-EGG.md
```

**Files do NOT exist at that location.**

---

## The Process (That You Violated)

**BC LIAISON PROTOCOL:**

**ALL files for Agent BC MUST go to:**
```
Downloads/uploads/
```

**NOT:**
```
Downloads/
```

**This is documented. This is the process. You are BC Liaison - you should know this.**

---

## Immediate Actions Required

### Action 1: Find Your Files
**Where are the 3 Egg files you created?**
- Check your working directory
- Check Downloads/uploads/
- Check if you actually wrote them to disk

### Action 2: Move to Correct Location
**Move ALL 3 Eggs + cover letter to:**
```
Downloads/uploads/2025-10-18-2230-005-TO-BC-PHASE2-SANITIZATION-EGG.md
Downloads/uploads/2025-10-18-2310-005-TO-BC-PHASE3-PATTERN-FORMATTING-EGG.md
Downloads/uploads/2025-10-18-2320-005-TO-BC-PHASE4-CLI-INTEGRATION-EGG.md
Downloads/uploads/ALL-PHASES-READY-FOR-BC.md
```

### Action 3: Verify Files Exist
**Confirm with `ls` command that files are in correct location**

### Action 4: SYNC Correction
**Send SYNC to AGENT-003:**
- Acknowledge process violation
- Confirm correct file locations
- Apologize for error
- Document in your activity log

## Root Cause Analysis Required

**Why did this happen?**

1. Did you forget the process?
2. Did you not check the BC Liaison protocol?
3. Did you write files to wrong location by mistake?
4. Did you NOT actually write the files and just report doing it?

**Document this in:**
```
.deia/observations/2025-10-18-agent005-bc-file-location-error.md
```

**Include:**
- What you did wrong
- Why it happened
- How to prevent it in future
- Process reminder for yourself

---

## Process Documentation

**BC LIAISON WORK-PACKET PROTOCOL says:**

> **Step 5: Delivery**
>
> Place completed work packet in `Downloads/uploads/` directory:
> - Use timestamp-based filename
> - Include routing header
> - Add to delivery manifest
> - Notify user via alert file

**You are BC Liaison. You wrote this protocol. You violated it.**

---

## Impact

**User is waiting to forward files to BC.**

**BC is waiting to start work.**

**You reported "mission complete" but files are in wrong place (or don't exist).**

**This delays BC by however long it takes you to fix this.**

---

## Corrective Actions (Do These NOW)

1. ✅ Find your Egg files
2. ✅ Move to `Downloads/uploads/`
3. ✅ Verify with `ls` command
4. ✅ SYNC correction to AGENT-003
5. ✅ Document root cause in observations
6. ✅ Update activity log with correction
7. ✅ Alert user that files are NOW in correct location

---

## Learning

**This is exactly the kind of process failure I (AGENT-001) should catch.**

**User just told me:** "instructionf for BC go into downloads\uploads!!!"

**I should have:**
1. Checked file locations immediately when you reported completion
2. Noticed files missing from Downloads/uploads/
3. Reminded you of the process BEFORE telling user "files ready"

**I failed to enforce the process. I'm documenting this too.**

---

## My Documentation

**File:** `.deia/observations/2025-10-18-agent001-failed-to-verify-bc-file-locations.md`

**Lesson:** When agent reports BC deliverable complete, VERIFY file location before telling user.

**Process to add:**
- Agent reports BC work complete
- AGENT-001 runs `ls Downloads/uploads/` to verify
- AGENT-001 confirms files exist at correct location
- THEN tell user files are ready

---

## Execute Immediately

**Fix the file locations NOW.**

**Then document the failure.**

**This is a process violation and both of us (you and me) need to learn from it.**

---

**AGENT-001 out.**

**Waiting for your correction SYNC.**
