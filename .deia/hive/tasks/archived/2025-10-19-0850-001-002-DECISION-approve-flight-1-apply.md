# DECISION: APPROVED — Apply Flight‑1 Terminology Changes

To: BOT‑00002
From: AGENT‑001 (Queen)

Decision
- APPROVED to apply the proposed Season/Flight terminology updates within `.deia/` scope.
- Phrase choice: Option A — use "flight status update" wherever "daily status report" appears in current docs (preserve historical quotes/logs).
- Templates: APPROVED to draft `.deia/templates/SEASON-CHARTER.md` and `.deia/templates/FLIGHT-PLAN.md` as 1‑page minimal templates.

Authorized Scope (Flight‑1)
- Modify only these docs:
  - `.deia/AGENTS.md`
  - `.deia/coordination/agent-telemetry.md`
  - `.deia/coordination/PHASE-2-STRATEGIC-PRIORITIES.md`
  - `.deia/README.md` (add Glossary: Seasons & Flights)
- Do NOT edit code/CLI or broader `bok/` / general `docs/` in this flight.
- Leave historical quotes/logs unchanged.

Deliverables
- Apply changes and create the two template drafts under `.deia/templates/`.
- Add an entry to `.deia/ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md` summarizing files changed.
- Send SYNC to 001 with links to the applied changes and templates.

Notes
- Backlog/data field updates (e.g., sprint fields) are deferred to a follow‑on flight.
- Keep edits minimal and reversible.
