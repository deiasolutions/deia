**Priority:** P0
**Status:** 5 Deep Analytics Tasks Queued
**Estimated Duration:** 8.5 hours (1.5-2 hours each)

## Task 1: Anomaly Detection Engine (2 hours)

**Spot unusual patterns before they become problems.**

- Create `AnomalyDetector` service
- Detect: Unusual task latency, queue depth, bot behavior
- Methods: Statistical baseline + machine learning (if available)
- Alert: Probabilistic alerts (80% confident = alert)
- Root cause: Suggest possible causes for anomalies
- Logging to `anomalies-detected.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/anomaly_detector.py`
**Integrate into:** `observability_api.py` for alert generation
**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] AnomalyDetector service created
- [ ] Statistical baseline calculation working
- [ ] Anomaly detection algorithm implemented
- [ ] Root cause suggestions generated
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-003-analytics-anomaly.md`

---

## Task 2: Correlational Analysis (1.5 hours)

**Find what factors affect system behavior.**

- Create `CorrelationAnalyzer` service
- Questions: Does CPU load correlate with task failures? Is queue depth growing?
- Analyze: Historical patterns (last 7 days, 30 days)
- Report: Correlation matrix (what affects what)
- Predictions: If X happens, Y will likely happen
- Logging to `correlation-analysis.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/correlation_analyzer.py`
**Integrate into:** `observability_api.py` for insights endpoint
**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] CorrelationAnalyzer service created
- [ ] Correlation matrix calculation working
- [ ] Historical pattern analysis (7-day, 30-day)
- [ ] Prediction logic implemented
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-003-analytics-correlation.md`

---

## Task 3: Heat Maps & Visualizations (1.5 hours)

**Generate data for dashboards.**

- Create `HeatMapGenerator` service
- Generate: Time-of-day heatmaps (when is system busiest?)
- Generate: Bot-usage heatmaps (which bots most used?)
- Generate: Task-type heatmaps (what tasks are common?)
- Format: JSON for frontend visualization
- Logging to `heatmap-data.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/heatmap_generator.py`
**Integrate into:** `observability_api.py` for visualization endpoint
**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] HeatMapGenerator service created
- [ ] Time-of-day heatmap generation working
- [ ] Bot-usage heatmap generation working
- [ ] Task-type heatmap generation working
- [ ] JSON output format verified
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-003-analytics-heatmaps.md`

---

## Task 4: Comparative Analysis (2 hours)

**Compare system behavior across time periods.**

- Create `ComparativeAnalyzer` service
- Compare: Today vs. yesterday, this week vs. last week
- Metrics: Throughput, latency, errors, resource usage
- Report: What changed? Is it good or bad?
- Trending: Is system getting better or worse?
- Logging to `comparative-reports.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/comparative_analyzer.py`
**Integrate into:** `observability_api.py` for comparison endpoint
**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] ComparativeAnalyzer service created
- [ ] Day-over-day comparison working
- [ ] Week-over-week comparison working
- [ ] Trending analysis implemented
- [ ] Change detection logic working
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-003-analytics-comparative.md`

---

## Task 5: Optimization Recommendations (1.5 hours)

**AI-driven suggestions for system improvement.**

- Create `OptimizationAdvisor` service
- Analyze: Current performance, bottlenecks, resource waste
- Recommend: Specific changes (increase X, decrease Y)
- Estimate: Expected improvement (CPU usage down 20%, etc.)
- Prioritize: Which optimizations have highest ROI
- Logging to `optimization-recommendations.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/optimization_advisor.py`
**Integrate into:** `observability_api.py` for recommendations endpoint
**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] OptimizationAdvisor service created
- [ ] Bottleneck detection logic implemented
- [ ] Recommendation generation working
- [ ] Impact estimation algorithm working
- [ ] ROI prioritization logic working
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-003-analytics-optimization.md`

---

## Work Schedule

**Task 1:** 2 hours (Anomaly Detection)
**Task 2:** 1.5 hours (Correlation Analysis)
**Task 3:** 1.5 hours (Heat Maps)
**Task 4:** 2 hours (Comparative Analysis)
**Task 5:** 1.5 hours (Optimization Advisor)

**Total:** 8.5 hours estimated
**Target Completion:** ~06:00 CDT tomorrow (based on 2-3x velocity)

---

## Quality Requirements

- ✅ Production code only (zero mocks)
- ✅ 70%+ test coverage per service
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Comprehensive logging to JSON files
- ✅ Type hints on all functions
- ✅ Docstrings on all public methods
- ✅ Integration verified with observability_api.py
- ✅ Zero breaking changes

---

## Integration Points

- **observability_api.py:** All services feed into unified observability endpoint
- **bot_service.py:** New endpoints for analytics queries
- **Monitoring suite:** Use data from bot_process_monitor, api_health_monitor, queue_analytics, failure_analyzer
- **Health dashboard:** Display anomalies and recommendations

---

## Success Definition

By completion of all 5 tasks:
- System detects anomalies before they impact users
- Correlations between factors understood
- Visual dashboards can show patterns over time
- Performance trending tracked automatically
- AI-driven optimization advice available
- Complete analytics system for full operational visibility

---

## Parallel Work

These tasks run in parallel with BOT-001's Production Hardening batch.
- Coordination point: When both batches complete
- Integration: Combined system = production-hardened + deep analytics
