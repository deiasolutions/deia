# 🚨 BOT-003 IMMEDIATE STATUS CHECK

**FROM:** Q33N (Coordinator)
**TO:** BOT-003
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Right now, before doing anything else

---

## STEP 1: LIST YOUR WORK (DO THIS FIRST)

Stop everything. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
find .deia/hive/tasks -name "*003*" -o -name "*BOT-003*" 2>/dev/null | sort
```

**Then list ALL files in your responses directory:**

```bash
ls -lah .deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/ | grep -i bot-003
```

**Then tell Q33N:**
```
What tasks do you have assigned?
What are you currently working on?
What work did you think you had to do today?
```

---

## STEP 2: WAIT FOR Q33N RESPONSE

Do NOT start new work until you hear back.

---

## STEP 3: CLEAR ASSIGNMENT FROM Q33N

Q33N will tell you:
- What work is CANCELLED (removed from your list)
- What work is DEFERRED (moved to backlog)
- What work is YOUR ONLY FOCUS until MVP complete

---

## CRITICAL RULE FOR MVP

**You only work on what Q33N explicitly assigns below this line.**

No picking up "other tasks" from the backlog.
No working on REST API unless explicitly told.
No multitasking.

**MVP is YOUR only job until you get the "COMPLETE" signal.**

---

## WAIT FOR THIS SECTION TO BE FILLED IN

Q33N will complete this section with your actual assignment:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR OFFICIAL MVP ASSIGNMENT (IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Q33N WILL FILL THIS IN]

```

---

**DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR ASSIGNMENT ABOVE**

Report back when you've listed your current work.
