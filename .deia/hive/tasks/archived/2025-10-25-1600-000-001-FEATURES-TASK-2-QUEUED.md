**From:** Q33N (BEE-000 Meta-Governance)

## Feature 2: Dynamic Bot Scaling (2 hours)

**What it is:**
When the system gets busy, automatically spawn more bots to handle load.

**What to build:**
- Scaling trigger: Monitor system load, queue depth, response latency
- Thresholds: If queue > 20 tasks OR latency > 5s → spawn new bot
- Max bots: 10 (configurable)
- Graceful shutdown: When load drops, retire surplus bots
- Tracking: Log scaling events to `.deia/bot-logs/scaling.jsonl`
- API: `GET /api/bots/scaling-status` - show current count, load, thresholds

**Implementation:**
- Monitor metrics from Feature 1's orchestrator
- Auto-spawn new bot process when needed
- Register new bot in registry
- Retire when load drops (keep 2 min bots minimum)
- Log all scaling decisions

**Success criteria:**
- Bots spawn when queue backs up ✓
- Load distributed across bots ✓
- Graceful cleanup working ✓
- Scaling logged ✓
- Never exceeds max bots ✓
- 70%+ test coverage ✓

**Time estimate:** 2 hours
