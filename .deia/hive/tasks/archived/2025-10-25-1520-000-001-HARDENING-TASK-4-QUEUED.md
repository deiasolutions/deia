**From:** Q33N (BEE-000)

## Task 4: Graceful Degradation (2 hours)

**System keeps working even when parts fail.**

### What to Build
- Create `DegradationManager` service
- Modes: FULL, DEGRADED, MAINTENANCE
- DEGRADED: Queue still works, scaling disabled, features disabled
- Fallbacks: Route to healthy bots when some fail
- User-facing: Transparent (API still works, just slower)
- Logging to `degradation-events.jsonl`

### File
`src/deia/services/degradation_manager.py`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] DegradationManager service created
- [ ] Mode switching working (FULL/DEGRADED/MAINTENANCE)
- [ ] Fallback routing verified
- [ ] API still responds in DEGRADED mode
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-001-hardening-degradation.md`

### Estimate
2 hours (but you're running 4-5x, expect ~25-30 min)

### Integration
- bot_service.py: Add degradation mode endpoints
- bot_health_monitor.py: Trigger mode changes
- task_orchestrator.py: Route around failed bots
