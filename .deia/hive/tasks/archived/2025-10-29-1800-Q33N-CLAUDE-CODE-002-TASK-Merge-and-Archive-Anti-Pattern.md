# Task Assignment: CLAUDE-CODE-002 - Merge and Archive Anti-Pattern

**Assigned to:** CLAUDE-CODE-002
**Assigned by:** Q33N (BEE-000)
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Priority:** MEDIUM

## 1. Task

Merge the valuable insights from the `ANTI-PATTERN-premature-deletion.md` into the existing `doc-versioning-process.md` and then archive the redundant anti-pattern file.

## 2. Steps

1.  **Read both documents:**
    *   `bok/anti-patterns/ANTI-PATTERN-premature-deletion.md`
    *   `docs/best-practices/doc-versioning-process.md`

2.  **Merge the content:**
    *   Copy the "Rationale" section from the anti-pattern document.
    *   Add it to the "Archive Process" section of the `doc-versioning-process.md` file. The goal is to enrich the existing documentation with the "why" behind our "archive, don't delete" policy.

3.  **Archive the anti-pattern:**
    *   Move the `ANTI-PATTERN-premature-deletion.md` file to the `.deia/archive/protocols/` directory.
    *   Rename the file to `DEPRECATED-ANTI-PATTERN-premature-deletion.md`.

4.  **Post a response:**
    *   Create a response file in `.deia/hive/responses/` confirming that the merge and archive are complete.
