## Protocol Reminders

- Sessions save to: `.deia/sessions/`

### ✅ Bug Fix Lookup First
- Before fixing: Check BUG_REPORTS.md
- 7-location search protocol
- Document new bugs
- **Why:** BUG-004 occurred 25+ times because we didn't check

### ✅ Integration Protocol
- ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md
- PROJECT-STATUS.csv
- Activity log (.deia/bot-logs/CLAUDE-CODE-00X-activity.jsonl)
- SYNC to coordinator
- **No exceptions**

### ✅ AI Hours Estimates
- Small: 15-45 min
- Medium: 1-3 hours
- Large: 3-5 hours
- Reference: `.deia/observations/2025-10-18-ai-planning-lessons-from-activity-logs.md`
- **We work in HOURS, not days**

### ✅ Check for Next Work
- After every completion
- `.deia/hive/tasks/*-YOUR_ID-*`
- Start immediately if found
- Include in SYNC: "Already started next task"
- **Goal:** <5 min idle time

### ✅ Quality Standards
- Test coverage: >80%
- Type hints on all functions
- Docstrings with examples
- Error handling (graceful degradation)
- No hardcoded secrets/paths
- Security-conscious (sanitize inputs)

- ❌ "in 3 days"

- ✅ "by end of season"
