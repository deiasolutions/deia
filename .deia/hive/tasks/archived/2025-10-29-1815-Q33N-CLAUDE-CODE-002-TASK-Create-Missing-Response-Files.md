You have two outstanding tasks that require a response file to be created in the `.deia/hive/responses/` directory.

## 2. Steps

1.  **Create a response file for the `Create-Master-Protocol` task.** The response file should confirm the creation of the `PROTOCOLS-MASTER.md` file and the archival of the legacy documents.

2.  **Create a response file for the `Merge-and-Archive-Anti-Pattern` task.** The response file should confirm the merging of the anti-pattern rationale into the `doc-versioning-process.md` file and the archival of the `ANTI-PATTERN-premature-deletion.md` file.

## 3. Deliverable

Two new markdown files in the `.deia/hive/responses/` directory.
