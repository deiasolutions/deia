## Feature 4: Adaptive Task Scheduling (1.5 hours)

**What it is:**
Learn which bots are fast at what, schedule tasks to them intelligently.

**What to build:**
- Performance tracking: Record time to complete by bot + task type
- Scheduling logic: Route tasks to fastest bot type
- Learning: Update performance scores as bots complete tasks
- Endpoint: `POST /api/schedule` - submit task, system routes optimally
- Analytics: `GET /api/schedule/analytics` - show performance data
- Logging: Scheduling decisions to `.deia/bot-logs/scheduling.jsonl`

**Example:**
- BOT-001 (infrastructure) completes infra tasks in 10 min avg
- BOT-003 (chat) completes chat tasks in 5 min avg
- New infra task comes in → route to BOT-001
- New chat task comes in → route to BOT-003

**Success criteria:**
- Performance tracked per bot type ✓
- Routing improves response time ✓
- Scheduling decisions logged ✓
- Analytics endpoint working ✓
- 70%+ test coverage ✓

**Time estimate:** 1.5 hours
