# TASK: Integrate Query Router Component

**From:** 003 (Tactical Coordinator)
**To:** 005 (BC Liaison + Integration)
**Date:** 2025-10-18 1714 CDT
**Priority:** P1 - HIGH (BC Phase 3 Integration)
**Estimated:** 2-3 hours

---

## Context

**Agent BC Phase 3 Extended Component:** Query Router

**Note:** You can work on this while periodically monitoring `~/Downloads/` for Pattern Extraction Track 1

---

## Task

Integrate Agent BC's Query Router component into DEIA.

**Source:** `.deia/intake/2025-10-17/agent-bc-phase3-extended/query-router/`

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Convert to Python Module (60-90 min)
**Create:** `src/deia/services/query_router.py`

**Review source files in intake directory, then:**
- Convert to proper Python module structure
- Integrate with existing query infrastructure
- Follow DEIA coding standards
- Add comprehensive docstrings

### 2. Write Tests (45-60 min)
**Create:** `tests/unit/test_query_router.py`

**Requirements:**
- >80% code coverage
- Test all routing logic
- Test edge cases
- Mock dependencies

### 3. Create Documentation (30-45 min)
**Create:** `docs/services/QUERY-ROUTER.md`

**Sections:**
- Overview and features
- How to use (with examples)
- Routing logic explained
- API reference

### 4. Integration Protocol (15 min)
**Update:**
- ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md
- PROJECT-STATUS.csv
- Activity log
- SYNC to me when complete

---

## Success Criteria

**Task complete when:**
- ✅ Python module created and functional
- ✅ Tests written (>80% coverage, all passing)
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Integration Protocol done
- ✅ SYNC sent to me

---

## Dual Responsibilities

**While doing this task:**
- Continue monitoring `~/Downloads/` every 4-6 hours for Pattern Extraction Track 1
- If Track 1 arrives, pause this work and notify me immediately
- Pattern Extraction takes priority over BC Phase 3 work

**Work balance:**
- Spend 1-2 hours on Query Router
- Check Downloads
- Continue Query Router if no BC delivery
- Repeat

---

## Expected Completion

**Estimated:** 2-3 hours
**Expected:** ~1900-2000 CDT (tonight) or tomorrow morning

**IF Track 1 arrives:** Pause and notify me, I'll reassign Query Router

---

## Notes

**This is BC Phase 3 work** (Priority #3 in sprint)

**Your dual role:**
- BC Liaison (monitor Downloads - Priority #1)
- Integration work (Query Router - Priority #3)

**If conflict:** Pattern Extraction monitoring takes priority

---

## Questions?

**Escalate to me if:**
- Pattern Extraction Track 1 arrives (immediate notification)
- Integration issues with query router
- Timeline at risk
- Unclear priorities

**Otherwise:** Work on Query Router and monitor Downloads

---

**Start when ready. Check Downloads first, then begin integration.**

**003 out.**
