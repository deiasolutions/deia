# BOT-001 EXTENDED WINDOW 1 - DO IN PARALLEL NOW
**From:** Q33N (BEE-000)
**To:** BOT-001
**Issued:** 2025-10-25 16:36 CDT
**Status:** ADDITIONAL WORK - DO NOW (don't wait for 18:32)
**Priority:** HIGH - Keep moving, no idle time

---

## ASSIGNMENT

You already have HIGH fixes + User Guide for 2 hours. WHILE DOING THOSE, also start these parallel tasks. Expand workload, keep typing.

---

## EXTENDED TASKS (Parallel, start immediately)

### 1. Testing Plan Documentation (1 hour parallel)
**File:** `.deia/docs/PORT-8000-TESTING-PLAN.md`

Create comprehensive testing plan for QA team. What should they test? How? What should pass?

**Include:**

#### Functional Tests (20 min)
```
## Functional Testing

### Bot Management
- [ ] Launch bot from dialog
  - Expected: Bot appears in sidebar, WebSocket connects
  - Test: Click launch → fill form → submit → verify bot listed

- [ ] Select bot from list
  - Expected: Chat clears, messages load for that bot
  - Test: Launch 2 bots → click bot 2 → verify chat switched

- [ ] Send command to bot
  - Expected: Command echoed back, bot responds
  - Test: Type "help" → send → receive response

- [ ] View chat history
  - Expected: Old messages appear in order when scrolling up
  - Test: Send 20+ messages → scroll up → verify order

- [ ] Stop bot
  - Expected: Bot removed from sidebar, WebSocket disconnects
  - Test: Click stop → verify offline
```

#### Performance Tests (15 min)
```
## Performance Testing

- [ ] Response time < 200ms
  - Tool: Browser DevTools Network tab
  - Test: 10 consecutive requests, measure average

- [ ] Chat renders 100+ messages without lag
  - Test: Load history with 100 messages, scroll smoothly

- [ ] WebSocket message latency < 100ms
  - Tool: Browser console, timestamp comparison
  - Test: Send message, measure time to receive confirmation
```

#### Accessibility Tests (15 min)
```
## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] All buttons keyboard accessible
  - Test: Tab through UI, activate with Enter

- [ ] Color contrast WCAG AA
  - Tool: Browser DevTools Accessibility tab
  - Test: All text readable on background

- [ ] Screen reader compatible
  - Tool: NVDA or browser reader
  - Test: Read through page, all elements announced
```

#### Error Handling Tests (10 min)
```
## Error Handling

- [ ] Bot crashes handled gracefully
  - Test: Kill bot process, UI shows offline, doesn't crash

- [ ] Connection lost handled
  - Test: Disconnect network, UI shows reconnecting, recovers

- [ ] Invalid input rejected
  - Test: Send malformed request, receive error message
```

### 2. Performance Baseline (1 hour parallel)
**File:** `.deia/reports/PORT-8000-PERFORMANCE-BASELINE.md`

Measure actual performance metrics. These become the acceptance criteria.

**Tests to Run:**

```markdown
# Port 8000 Performance Baseline

## Test Environment
- Browser: Chrome 120
- Hardware: [your machine specs]
- Network: Local (no latency)
- Bot: Mock bot for consistent responses

## Measurements

### API Response Times
Test: GET /api/bots (bot list)
- Cold: 150ms
- Warm: 45ms
- Average: 87ms
- Target: < 200ms ✅

Test: POST /api/message (send command)
- Average: 120ms
- Target: < 200ms ✅

### WebSocket Latency
Test: Send message → receive confirmation
- Average: 42ms
- Target: < 100ms ✅

### UI Rendering
Test: Chat history with 50 messages loads
- Time to interactive: 320ms
- Target: < 500ms ✅

### Memory Usage
Test: Chat with 100+ messages in history
- Initial: 45MB
- After 100 messages: 62MB
- Delta: 17MB (acceptable)
- No memory leak detected ✅

## Conclusion
All metrics meet or exceed targets.
Baseline established for regression testing.
```

## HOW TO BALANCE IN 2 HOURS

You have HIGH fixes + User Guide taking 2 hours, plus these 2 new parallel tasks.

**Suggested Timeline (16:36 - 18:32):**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 16:36-16:50 | Start HIGH fixes (status polling, feedback) |
| 16:50-17:10 | Parallel: Start testing plan documentation |
| 17:10-17:40 | Continue HIGH fixes (error messages, pagination) |
| 17:40-17:55 | Parallel: Performance baseline measurements |
| 17:55-18:15 | Finish User Guide documentation |
| 18:15-18:32 | Assemble all reports and finalize status |

**Alternative:** Work in tabs:
- Tab 1: Code editor (fixing issues)
- Tab 2: Markdown editor (testing plan)
- Tab 3: Browser DevTools (performance measurements)

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

At 18:32 CDT, you should have completed:
- ✅ HIGH priority fixes (4 issues)
- ✅ User Guide (5 sections)
- ✅ Testing plan (comprehensive test matrix)
- ✅ Performance baseline (actual metrics measured)

**Total: 4 deliverables in 2 hours**

---

## STATUS REPORT

**Due:** 2025-10-25 18:32 CDT

Update: `BOT-001-HIGH-FIXES-USER-GUIDE-WINDOW-1-COMPLETE.md`

**Add sections:**
- HIGH fixes: COMPLETE (all 4?)
- User Guide: COMPLETE (file location)
- Testing plan: COMPLETE (file location)
- Performance baseline: COMPLETE (file location, key metrics)
- Key findings: [list any issues discovered during testing]
- All 4 deliverables ready

---

## NOTES

- These are PARALLEL tasks - fixes stay priority #1
- Spend ~50% on fixes, 50% on documentation/testing
- Testing plan helps QA team prevent regressions
- Performance baseline catches performance regressions early
- No idle time: Keep working continuously
