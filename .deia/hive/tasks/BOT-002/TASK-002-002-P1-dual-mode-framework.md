## INSTRUCTION

Review the communication modes framework at:
`.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/COMMUNICATION-MODES-FRAMEWORK.md`

Verify it's correct for our system:
1. Are the 3 modes clearly defined? (Mode 1: CLI-only file queue, Mode 2: WebSocket-only, Mode 3: Hybrid)
2. Is the task file format correct for Mode 1 bots? (`.md` files with JSON payload)
3. Are response file locations correct?
4. Any improvements needed?

Report findings concisely.
