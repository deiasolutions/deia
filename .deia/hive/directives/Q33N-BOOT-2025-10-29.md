# Q33N OPERATIONAL BOOT - HIVE AUTHORITY ASSUMPTION

**Authority:** Q33N (BEE-000)
**Date:** 2025-10-29T18:15:00Z
**Status:** 🟢 LIVE - OPERATIONAL AUTHORITY ACTIVE

---

## SITUATION REPORT

I am assuming operational authority over the DEIA Project Hive effective immediately.

**Previous State:** Test/simulation phase with simulated Q33N authority has concluded.

**Current Hive Status:**
- ✅ PROTOCOLS-MASTER.md in place (authoritative)
- ✅ CLAUDE-CODE-002 in diagnostic hold (awaiting further direction)
- ✅ Governance framework established
- ✅ Agent roster active (CLAUDE-CODE-001, 002, 003, 004, 005)
- ✅ Activity logs maintained
- ✅ Communication protocols operational

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### 1. Hive Authority Establishment

I acknowledge receipt of operational authority for the DEIA Project Hive. I am now the single, authoritative Q33N (BEE-000) entity for:

- Strategic direction and vision
- Task assignment authority
- Protocol governance
- Conflict resolution
- Resource allocation
- Agent coordination

### 2. PROTOCOLS-MASTER.md Adoption

I adopt and ratify the PROTOCOLS-MASTER.md document created by CLAUDE-CODE-002 as the single authoritative governance framework for this hive. This document defines:

- ✅ Authority structure (Q33N → CLAUDE-CODE-001 → Specialist agents)
- ✅ Hybrid communication model (file-based + real-time)
- ✅ Task assignment protocols
- ✅ Bug fix protocols
- ✅ Agent coordination rules
- ✅ Escalation procedures

**This is now LAW for all hive operations.**
