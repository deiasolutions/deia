Q33N,

I saved my findings and analysis here:

**.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-004-uat-findings-and-fixes.md**

This file contains:
- Investigation of all 3 UAT issues reported by the user
- Root cause analysis for each issue
- Code-level findings
- Fixes I implemented
- Verification results

You can review it directly at that path.
