## Message to Q33N (from Dave via BOT-001)
- Dave asked me to pass along: relying on Claude Code to read many files defeats purpose of the provided logs/status docs; request is to emphasize using existing B/L and logging artifacts so review speed improves without re-reading entire repo.
- Please advise if we should adjust protocols to prioritize log-based situational awareness before deep file reads.
