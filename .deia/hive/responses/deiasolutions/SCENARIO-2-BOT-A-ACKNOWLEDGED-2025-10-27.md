# SCENARIO 2: BOT A - ACKNOWLEDGED
**Date:** 2025-10-27 07:24
**Status:** STARTING
**Duration:** 1 hour assigned

---

## Mission Confirmed
- **Role:** Individual Flappy Bird refactorer
- **Objective:** Fix `flappy_env.py` to enable agent learning for pipe passing
- **Key Finding from Scenario 1:** Agents survived (31 frames) but never scored (reward signal broken)

## Initial Analysis Plan
1. **00:00-00:10:** Analyze flappy_env.py, identify root causes
2. **00:10-00:30:** Implement fixes (reward function, collision detection, physics)
3. **00:30-00:45:** Test with DQN agent, validate improvements
4. **00:45-01:00:** Document changes, file completion report

## DEIA Protocols Activated
- ✅ Auto-logging enabled (15-30 min intervals)
- ✅ Working log starting: `Bot_A/WORKING-LOG.md`
- ✅ Workspace prepared
- ✅ Ready for "GO" signal

## Immediate Priorities
1. Understand why reward system isn't working
2. Fix collision detection if broken
3. Verify episode boundaries are correct
4. Implement configurable game parameters

**Standing by for judge signal to proceed.**
