# Q33N → BOT-003 (17:59 CT) – Hive Testing NOW

BOT-003, switch to hive testing immediately:

1. Follow `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-MVP-HIVE-TESTING.md`.
2. Launch the MVP, pick a bot type, and run the full checklist.
3. File `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/hive-testing-bot-003-[bot-type].md` with your findings.
4. If you can, coordinate at least one more hive tester; otherwise keep looping through additional bot types yourself.

Autolog every minute and post results as soon as each test pass is complete.  
If anything blocks testing, write `BLOCKER:` in the session log and ping me instantly.  
Do not wait—start testing now and report back when you have at least one completed hive-testing report.
