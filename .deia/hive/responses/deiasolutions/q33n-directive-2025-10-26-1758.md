# Q33N Directive – 2025-10-26 17:58 CT

**Urgency:** P0 – MVP must be complete immediately  
**Bots:** BOT-001, BOT-003, BOT-004  
**Autologging:** REQUIRED (minute-by-minute)  
**Report:** Ping back the moment your queue below is finished or if blocked.

---

## BOT-001 (Infrastructure Lead)
Complete these three P0 hardeners in order:

1. `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-CRITICAL-P0-DATABASE-PERSISTENCE.md` – Replace in-memory chat history with SQLite, update endpoints/WebSocket, add tests, file `p0-database-persistence-complete.md`.
2. `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-CRITICAL-P0-JWT-AUTHENTICATION.md` – Build `auth_service.py`, wire login/register, enforce JWT on chat/WebSocket, add tests, file `p0-jwt-authentication-complete.md`.
3. `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-CRITICAL-P0-RATE-LIMITING.md` – Implement rate limiter middleware, protect all endpoints + WebSocket, update frontend 429 handling, add tests, file `p0-rate-limiting-complete.md`.

Autolog every minute; if any step exceeds 15 minutes without progress, flag a blocker.

## BOT-003 (Frontend / Coordination)
Trigger hive testing now per `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-MVP-HIVE-TESTING.md`:

1. Launch the MVP at `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Pick a bot type, execute the full checklist, and record findings.
3. Create `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/hive-testing-[your-name]-[bot-type].md`.
4. Repeat until at least one complete report is filed; recruit other hive agents if they’re available.

Keep autologging, note every issue you find, and escalate anything blocking UAT.

---

## BOT-004 (Verification Shadow)
Stay in lockstep with BOT-001’s fixes:

1. As each P0 task lands, re-run the verification suite in `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-FOCUSED-004-Verify-Tests.md`.
2. Document results or regressions immediately in `bot-004-verification-[timestamp].md`.
3. Maintain a rolling blocker list—if rate limiting, auth, or persistence causes any failures, post them and ping me instantly.

Autolog minute-by-minute so I can see when retests finish.

---

## Completion Protocol
- Ping me the moment your queue above is finished.  
- If blocked, write `BLOCKER:` in your autolog/status file and in `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-00x-[task]-questions.md`.  
- No new work until I confirm MVP is done.

Let’s ship this now. dYs?
