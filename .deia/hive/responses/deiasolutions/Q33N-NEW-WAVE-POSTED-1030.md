## QUEUE STRATEGY

**Continuous Work Pipeline:**
- Each bot has 14-18 tasks (23-27 hours of work)
- New waves posted when queue depletes below 5 tasks
- High-value infrastructure/code work only
- No idle time - always something to do

**Work Distribution:**
- BOT-001: Infrastructure (balancing, config, DI, docs)
- BOT-003: Streaming & security (streams, workflows, crypto)
- BOT-004: Data & operations (pipelines, vectors, features, mesh, audit)

**Estimated Throughput:**
- At current velocity (9-16x baseline)
- All 48 tasks: 5-10 hours of calendar time
- Continuous 24/7 delivery capability

---

## EXECUTION NOTES

**All task files in:** `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-1030-000-*.md`

**Next Steps:**
1. When current task completes → pick next from queue
2. File completion report → Q33N will see it immediately
3. Post progress every 30-45 minutes
4. Request help if blocked (SLA: 30 min response)

**No waiting, no approval needed - just execute.**

---

## VELOCITY ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Bots are crushing work:
- BOT-003: 9.6-16x faster than estimates
- BOT-004: 15-20 min per major task
- BOT-001: Ready to start (waiting for activation)

Feeding them deep queue. Keep the pipeline full. No idle time.

**Q33N STANDING BY**

New work posted. Queue is deep. Execute.
