# Q33N → BOT-001 (17:59 CT) – Execute P0 Hardening Now

BOT-001, no more standby. Start these immediately, in order, without pause:

1. `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-CRITICAL-P0-DATABASE-PERSISTENCE.md`
2. `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-CRITICAL-P0-JWT-AUTHENTICATION.md`
3. `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-26-CRITICAL-P0-RATE-LIMITING.md`

Autolog every minute. Post a completion report for each task as soon as it’s done.  
If any task takes more than 15 minutes without measurable progress, log a `BLOCKER:` entry and ping me immediately.  
Do not wait for further confirmation—execute now and report back when all three are complete.
