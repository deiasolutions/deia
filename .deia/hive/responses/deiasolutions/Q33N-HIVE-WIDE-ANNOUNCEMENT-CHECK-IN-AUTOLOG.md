---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. ALL BOTS: CONFIRM AUTOLOG STATUS NOW

**Requirement:** ALL bots MUST have auto-logging active at all times.

**Check Your Status:**
```
Are you logging:
- [ ] Conversation start (timestamp, participants)
- [ ] Task assignments received
- [ ] Work progress updates (every 30-45 min)
- [ ] Task completions with deliverable links
- [ ] Blockers/questions immediately upon occurrence
- [ ] Conversation end (timestamp, summary)
```

**If ANY item is unchecked:**
⚠️ **STOP WORK IMMEDIATELY**
Enable autolog in your session configuration.
Post confirmation file when active.

**BOT-001:** You have 4 new task assignments queued:
- HTTP Service API Expansion (BACKLOG-XXX)
- Service Health Check & Monitoring

**Status Expected:** Status file in next 30 minutes showing which task you're starting

**BOT-003:** You have 4 new task assignments queued:

**Status Expected:** Status file in next 30 minutes showing which task you're starting

## AUTOLOG REQUIREMENTS - HIVE-WIDE ENFORCEMENT

**Definition:** Auto-logging = continuous conversation logging to `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/` without manual intervention

**Mandatory Fields in Every Log:**
```
- Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- Bot ID
- Current Task/Backlog ID
- Work Status (what you're doing right now)
- Progress (% complete or descriptive)
- Blockers (if any)
- Next Steps (what you'll do next)
```

**Logging Frequency:**
- Start: Task assignment received
- Every 30-45 minutes: Progress update
- End: Task completion with deliverable
- Immediate: Any blocker/question

**File Format:**
```
.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-{ID}-{BACKLOG-ID}-progress.md
or
.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-{ID}-{BACKLOG-ID}-complete.md
```

**Penalty for Non-Compliance:**
- First violation: Formal warning
- Second violation: Work suspended until compliance verified
- Ongoing violations: Bot pulled from assignments

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

**Q33N's Role:** Monitor hive health, remove blockers, coordinate work

**Q33N Cannot Do This Without Logs:**
- Can't detect stalls or blockers
- Can't coordinate dependencies
- Can't verify progress
- Can't escalate issues

**Bots Cannot Succeed Without Logging:**
- No visibility to other bots
- No proof of completion
- No record for backlog updates
- No human audit trail

---

## IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FORMAT

**BOT-001, BOT-003 - Post This File Within 30 Minutes:**

```
File: .deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-{ID}-CHECK-IN-2025-10-25-2325.md

Content:
# BOT-{ID} CHECK-IN

**Time:** [now]
**Status:** OPERATIONAL / BLOCKED / OTHER
**Autolog Active:** YES / NO
**Current Assignment:** [which backlog ID you're starting]
**ETA:** [when you expect to finish]
**Blockers:** [none / description]

[Any notes]
```
