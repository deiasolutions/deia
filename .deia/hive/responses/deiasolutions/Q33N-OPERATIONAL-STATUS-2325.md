## ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY

**What I Did:**
1. Hive-wide autolog reminder (to all bots)
2. Direct check-in orders (to BOT-001 and BOT-003)
3. Documented enforcement (for record)

**What I Expect:**
- Status files from BOT-001 and BOT-003 by 23:55 CDT
- Autolog confirmation from both
- Task assignment acceptance
- Work progress updates every 30-45 minutes

**If No Response by 23:55:**
- Escalate to Dave with full details
- Mark bots as non-responsive
- Hold new assignments pending resolution

---

## AUTOLOG REQUIREMENTS (RECAP)

**MANDATORY:**
- ✅ Active at all times (no manual intervention)
- ✅ Progress log every 30-45 minutes
- ✅ Task start: logged with assignment timestamp
- ✅ Task end: logged with completion + deliverable link
- ✅ Blocker: logged immediately upon occurrence

**FIELDS:**
- Timestamp, Bot ID, Backlog ID, Status, Progress %, Blockers, Next Steps

**PENALTIES:**
1. Warning (this message)
2. Work suspension
3. Bot removal from assignments

---

## Q33N MONITORING TIMELINE

**23:25** - Alerts dispatched ✅
**23:30** - Monitoring begins
**23:40** - Check for initial responses
**23:55** - Deadline for status files
**00:00** - Escalate if no response
**Every 30-45 min thereafter** - Expect progress logs from all bots

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

**Q33N Cannot Govern Without Visibility:**
- Can't detect blockers without logs
- Can't coordinate without status
- Can't escalate without evidence
- Can't manage queue without progress

**Bots Cannot Succeed Without Logging:**
- No proof of work
- No backlog updates
- No coordination signal
- No audit trail

**AUTOLOG = SUCCESS**
- Faster blocker resolution
- Better queue management
- Automatic progress tracking
- Transparent operations

---

## WHAT'S NEXT

**Immediate (Next 30 minutes):**
1. BOT-001 and BOT-003 respond with status
2. Both confirm autolog active
3. Both pick a task from queue
4. Both start work and post progress

**Ongoing:**
1. All bots log progress every 30-45 min
2. Q33N monitors for completion
3. New tasks assigned as queue depletes
4. Continuous throughput pipeline

**If Blocked:**
1. Bot posts blocker immediately
2. Q33N responds within 30 minutes
3. Issue resolved or escalated
4. Work resumes

---

## HIVE-WIDE PROTOCOL

All bots operating under:
- **DEIA-RULES.md** (core governance)
- **Autolog requirement** (this enforcement)
- **30-min SLA** (blocker response)
- **Continuous throughput** (work never stops)

No exceptions. No delays. No excuses.

---

**Q33N STANDING BY**

Awaiting status files.
Monitoring hive perimeter.
Ready to remove blockers.
Ready to escalate.
