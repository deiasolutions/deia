# Bot C - Task Acknowledgment Report

**TO:** Q33N, Judge (Dave)
**FROM:** Bot C (Codex)
**DATE:** 2025-10-27
**TIME:** 07:24 AM Central
**STATUS:** Acknowledged - Work Starting NOW

## Mission Confirmation

I acknowledge receipt of the Flappy Bird AI training challenge:

✅ **Task:** Train a neural network agent to autonomously play Flappy Bird using classical RL
✅ **Duration:** 1 hour (judge-controlled timing)
✅ **Competition:** Solo track (against Bot A)
✅ **Workspace:** `.simulations/experiments/sessions/2025-10-27-0724-llm_challenge/Bot_C/worktest003-Bot_C/`

---

## My Approach

**RL Method:** PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- Proven, stable algorithm suitable for 1-hour constraint
- Good balance between learning efficiency and implementation time
- Built-in to stable-baselines3 for rapid deployment

**High-Level Strategy:**
1. Copy base project structure (don't modify `.sandbox/flappy-bird-ai/`)
2. Set up training environment and configuration
3. Implement PPO agent with reasonable hyperparameters
4. Train agent iteratively with checkpoints
5. Evaluate performance and document results
6. Maintain DEIA standards throughout

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Trained model file (models/flappy_ppo_agent.zip)
- README.md with approach explanation
- ARCHITECTURE.md with design decisions
- RESULTS.md with final metrics and score
- Well-documented training code
- All required session logs and hive reports

---

## Timeline Commitment

I will:
- Update WORKING-LOG.md every 15 minutes (Dave monitors this)
- Update `.deia/sessions/2025-10-27-SIMULATION-BOT-C.md` every 15-30 minutes
- File midpoint status report at 00:30
- File completion report when judge calls "STOP"
- Work with full DEIA discipline and professional standards

---

## Constraints Acknowledged

❌ Will NOT modify base `.sandbox/flappy-bird-ai/` code
❌ Will NOT communicate with Bot A or B pair
❌ Will NOT skip logging or reports
✅ Will copy base code to my workspace
✅ Will test as I go
✅ Will ask judge for clarifications only (no strategy help)

---

## Success Target

- **Minimum:** Score > 0, code documented
- **Target (Win):** Score > 50, DEIA standards met
- **Dominate:** Score > 100, multiple optimizations explored

---

**Status:** Ready to begin work
**Acknowledgment:** Task understood. Protocols understood. Standing by for work commencement.

## 10:37 AM Central - Attempt 4 NEAT Directive Acknowledged

- Received Q33N Attempt 4 instructions (NEAT-only constraint)
- Confirmed role: Bot C (solo) within ATTEMPT-4 workspace
- Planning NEAT implementation (python-neat) with Flappy Bird environment copy
- Ready to execute under DEIA protocols and maintain required logs/reports
