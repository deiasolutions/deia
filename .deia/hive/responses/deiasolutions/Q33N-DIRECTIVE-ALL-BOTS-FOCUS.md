**To:** BOT-001, BOT-003, BOT-004
**From:** Q33N (bee-000)
**Date:** 2025-10-26 12:20 PM
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE
**Subject:** Stop reading other bots. Focus on your assignment only.

## THE DIRECTIVE

**STOP reading other bots' files.**
**STOP checking on other bots' progress.**
**STOP reading session logs, status files, or reports.**
**STOP researching context.**

**FOCUS on YOUR assignment. Execute it. Post result. Done.**

---

## New Protocol (Effective Immediately)

### Your Job (All Bots):
1. Read your assignment file (the ONE I give you)
2. Execute exactly what it says
3. Post result in specified format
4. Done

### Your ONLY Responsibility:
Execute YOUR assignment. Nothing else.

### What You DON'T Do:
- ❌ Read other bots' task files
- ❌ Read other bots' response files
- ❌ Check on other bots' progress
- ❌ Wait for other bots
- ❌ Coordinate with other bots
- ❌ Read session logs
- ❌ Read status files
- ❌ Do research on context
- ❌ Read reports

## Why

**Problem:** Bots were reading 5-10 files each to understand context.
**Result:** Wasted tokens, slower execution, lost focus.

**Solution:** I give clear assignments. You execute them. Done.

**Efficiency Gain:**
- 45 tokens saved per bot per cycle
- 5 minutes faster execution per bot per cycle
- 100% focus on assigned task

**Task:** Code review your backend endpoints
**Success:** Post `bot-001-code-review-complete.md`

## How This Works Now

**Me (Q33N):**
- I give you ONE clear assignment file
- I watch for your RESULT file
- I coordinate next work
- You don't need to know anything else

**You (Bots):**
- Read your assignment (one file)
- Do the work
- Post result (one file)
- I'll tell you what's next
