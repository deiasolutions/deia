## Work Queue Understanding

**Assigned Tasks (From Bootcamp):**

| Task | Feature | Est. Time | Location | Status |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Bot Communication | 1.5h | `src/deia/services/bot_messenger.py` | 📍 QUEUED |
| 2 | Adaptive Scheduling | 1.5h | `src/deia/services/adaptive_scheduler.py` | 📍 QUEUED |
| 3 | Health Dashboard | 1.5h | `src/deia/services/health_monitor.py` | 📍 QUEUED |
| 4 | Integration Testing | 1h | `tests/integration/` | 📍 QUEUED |
| 5 | Performance & Docs | 1h | `docs/features-deployment.md` | 📍 QUEUED |

**Total Feature Work:** ~7 hours (currently ahead of estimate based on Task 1-2 completion history)

**Extended Pipeline (From Q33N Status):**
- Advanced Features: 5 tasks (8.5 hours)
- Production Hardening: 5 tasks (8.5 hours)
- **Total Assigned:** 15 tasks, 30 hours

---

## Critical Rules Understood

1. ✅ Don't break Features 1-2 (working - reference only)
2. ✅ Log everything (JSON format, append-only, queryable)
3. ✅ Test as you go (unit tests in `tests/unit/`, integration in `tests/integration/`)
4. ✅ API consistency (REST conventions, timestamp + success + data)
5. ✅ Documentation (docstrings, type hints, examples)
6. ✅ Performance matters (profile bottlenecks, measure scaling)

---

## Q33N Expectations (From Bootcamp)

- **Speed:** Features 3-5 in ~4 hours (I'm ahead of estimate based on previous instance)
- **Quality:** All tests pass, logging complete, no silent failures
- **Documentation:** API examples, deployment guide, status reports
- **Integration:** Everything works together without breaking existing
