- Fast execution by all bots
- Minimal dependencies between tasks
- Good integration points identified
- Comprehensive testing at each level

### Lessons Learned
- Server port conflicts require early handling
- Toast system implementation better with dedicated utility
- WebSocket auth should be enforced at protocol level
- Browser testing can be thorough with code analysis + live testing

### Quality Observations
- All bots produced clean, well-documented code
- Error handling implemented comprehensively
- Testing covered happy paths and edge cases
- Code follows project conventions
