## Queue Timeline (Estimated)

**Current Time:** 22:30 CDT

**BOT-001 Next Phase:**
- Advanced Features Task 2: ~23:45 CDT (in progress)
- Advanced Features Task 3: ~01:15 CDT
- Advanced Features Task 4: ~02:45 CDT
- Advanced Features Task 5: ~04:15 CDT

## Zero Idle Time Guarantee

✅ **BOT-001:** 21 hours of work queued = ~10 hours of uninterrupted execution ahead
✅ **BOT-003:** 15 hours of work queued = ~7-8 hours of uninterrupted execution ahead

Both bots will execute without pause through:
1. Current work (Advanced Features/Observability)
2. Next batch (Production Hardening / Deep Analytics)

If velocity continues at 2-3x, both batches will complete faster, and additional work will be required.

---

## Workload Assessment

**Normal Operating Workload:**
- BOT-001: 4-5 tasks (8-10 hours) queued = ✅ NORMAL (currently 21h)
- BOT-003: 4-5 tasks (8-10 hours) queued = ✅ NORMAL (currently 15h)

**Assessment:** Both bots are at **peak normal workload** with sufficient queue depth to maintain high velocity without overload.

---

## Next Actions

1. **Monitor current executions** (Advanced Features Task 2 + Advanced Observability Task 1)
2. **When Advanced Features Task 5 completes:** Formally begin Production Hardening Batch
3. **When Advanced Observability Task 5 completes:** Formally begin Deep Analytics Batch
4. **If bots complete early:** Have additional work batch ready (integration testing, performance optimization, etc.)

---

## Workload Quality

All queued tasks meet:
- ✅ Production code specification (zero mocks)
- ✅ 70%+ test coverage requirement
- ✅ Comprehensive logging requirement
- ✅ Type hints + docstrings requirement
- ✅ Integration verification requirement

---

**Q33N Queue Management**
**Status:** NOMINAL - Normal workload maintained
**Next Review:** Upon completion of current Advanced Features/Observability batches
