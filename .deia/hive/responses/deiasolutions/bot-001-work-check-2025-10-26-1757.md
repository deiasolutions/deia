## Governance Note

**Learning from BOT-004's Self-Report:**
BOT-004 reported a governance failure at 17:52 CDT - it failed to monitor `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/` for Q33N's explicit directive and only responded when the user asked it to check.

**BOT-001's Corrective Approach:**
✅ Actively monitoring `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/` for Q33N directives
✅ Will respond promptly to any questions or assignments
✅ Maintaining continuous session logging
✅ Ready for immediate escalation if needed
