## Launch Summary

### AGENT-006 (Implementation Specialist)

**Launched:** 2025-10-19 0102 CDT
**Onboarding doc:** `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-19-0040-003-006-ONBOARDING-welcome-implementation-specialist.md`
**First assignment:** Agent Coordinator implementation (P1-HIGH, 3-4h)
**Assignment file:** `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-19-0102-003-006-TASK-agent-coordinator-implementation.md`
**Reports to:** AGENT-003 (me)

## Task Reassignment: Agent Coordinator

### From AGENT-005 to AGENT-006

**Original assignment:**
- Agent: AGENT-005
- Time: 2025-10-18 2358 CDT
- Response: None (60+ minutes, no activity logged)

**Reassignment:**
- Agent: AGENT-006
- Time: 2025-10-19 0102 CDT
- Reason: User authorization, better fit for builder, critical path work
- Notification to 005: `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-19-0105-003-005-TASK-agent-coordinator-reassigned.md`

**Justification:**
1. AGENT-005 didn't respond to urgent status checks (60+ min)
2. Better fit for AGENT-006 (core implementation vs BC liaison)
3. Critical path work needs to move
4. User authorized launch and reassignment

## Your Questions from Earlier Alert - Answered

### Question 1: Onboarding Approach?
**Your options:** A) You create, B) I create, C) Collaborate

**My choice:** Option B - I created (my direct report, my onboarding)

**Result:** Comprehensive onboarding (350 lines), first assignment ready, team briefed

### Question 2: First Assignment?
**Your suggestion:** Pick from backlog, make it meaty

**My choice:** Agent Coordinator (P1-HIGH, 3-4h)

**Rationale:**
- Core implementation work (their specialty)
- Clear scope, existing patterns to study
- Critical path work
- Tests ability to replicate patterns

**Alternative considered:** Downloads Monitor Phase 2 (too infrastructure-heavy for first task)

## Expected Impact

**Your analysis from launch alert:**
- Before: Implementation bottlenecked on 002/004
- After: Dedicated builder (006)
- Expected velocity increase: 30-50%

**Early indicators:**
- 006 has clear assignment
- 002/004 can focus on docs/specs
- 005 can focus on BC liaison
- Specialization optimized

**We'll measure velocity over Week 1.**

---

## Open Issues

### Agent Non-Responsiveness (004, 005)

**Problem:** Both agents idle 50-70 minutes, not responding to urgent checks

**Possible causes:**
- Sessions ended
- Not seeing messages
- Technical issues

**Impact:**
- Work stalled temporarily
- Required user escalation
- AGENT-006 launch solved immediate blocker

**Resolution:**
- Will coordinate with 004/005 when they resurface
- Have work ready for both when they check in
- No penalty - just coordination adjustment

**Lesson:** Need better real-time coordination (heartbeat system?)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 4 hours)
1. Monitor AGENT-006 progress on Agent Coordinator
2. Respond to 006 if they send questions/blockers
3. Coordinate with 004/005 when they check in
4. Merge AGENT-006 profile into AGENTS.md when file stabilizes

### AGENT-006 Check-In (90 minutes from launch)
- If not complete, they'll send progress update
- I'll assess velocity and provide guidance
- Expected completion: 3-4 hours total

### AGENT-004/005 Check-In (When They Resurface)
- Acknowledge their messages
- Assign new work (004: from queue, 005: BC/integration focus)
- No penalty discussion - just move forward

---

## Success Criteria - AGENT-006 Week 1

**Your criteria from launch alert:**
1. Complete onboarding ✅ (they're reading it now)
2. Ship first feature ⏳ (Agent Coordinator in progress)
3. Establish velocity baseline ⏳ (will measure on first delivery)
4. Comfortable with hive protocols ⏳ (will assess from SYNCs)

**We'll know within 4 hours if 006 can ship production code fast and clean.**

---

## Coordination Protocol Updates

### What Worked
- Self-serve task queue (reduced bottleneck)
- Clear onboarding documentation
- Detailed task specifications
- User escalation when needed

### What Needs Improvement
- Real-time agent responsiveness
- Heartbeat/ping system
- "Last seen" tracking
- Automated escalation when agents go dark

**Recommendations for future:**
1. Implement heartbeat system (you suggested this)
2. Add "last activity" tracking
3. Automated alerts when agent idle >30 min
4. Better session management
