## Crash Analysis

### Impact Assessment
**Data Loss:** NONE
**Work Loss:** NONE
**Recovery Time:** 45 minutes
**Agent Downtime:** Minimal (all agents completed work before crash)

### What Saved Us
1. ✅ Activity logging - All agents had complete logs
2. ✅ Work completion timing - All agents finished tasks before crash
3. ✅ Integration Protocol - Proper documentation tracking
4. ✅ Communication protocol - Clear message system enabled quick recovery

### Lessons Learned
1. Activity logging is mission-critical
2. Complete work before context switches (good instincts from agents)
3. Communication protocol v2.1 (hive structure) is working well
4. Recovery protocol should be documented

## Current Sprint Status

### Active Sprint: Phase 2 Foundation
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Coordination:** Tactical (me) + Strategic (you)

### Backlog Snapshot (From BACKLOG.md)
**Phase 2 tasks queued:**

- Pattern Extraction CLI (work plan ready, awaiting BC)
- Web dashboard (optional)

### BC Pipeline
**Pattern Extraction Work Plan:** ✅ Ready for approval
**Phase 3 Remaining:** 3 components ready for integration

## Immediate Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Priority 1: Resume Sprint Coordination
**Action:** I resume Tactical Coordinator duties
**Scope:** Assign tasks to AGENT-002, 004, 005 from Phase 2 backlog
**Timeline:** Immediate

### Priority 2: Approve Pattern Extraction Work Plan
**Action:** You or I approve AGENT-005's Pattern Extraction work plan
**Impact:** Unblocks Agent BC for major feature development
**Timeline:** Within 1 hour

### Priority 3: Complete BC Phase 3
**Action:** Assign 3 remaining Phase 3 Extended components
**Options:**
- Enhanced BOK Search → AGENT-004 or AGENT-005
- Session Logger → AGENT-002 or AGENT-005
- Health Check System → Already complete (by me + AGENT-004)
**Timeline:** Next 2-4 hours

### Priority 4: Phase 2 Sprint Assignments
**Action:** Tactical coordination of Phase 2 tasks
**Agents:** All available, full capacity
**Timeline:** Rest of today + tomorrow

## My Next Plans (AGENT-003)

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. ✅ Send this recovery report to you
2. 📋 Review Pattern Extraction work plan (if you delegate approval to me)
3. 📋 Check Phase 2 backlog for task routing

### Short-term (Next 2-4 hours)
1. **Tactical Coordination:**
   - Route Phase 2 tasks to agents based on specializations
   - Monitor progress via activity logs
   - Coordinate dependencies between agents
   - Handle blockers and escalations

2. **BC Phase 3 Completion:**
   - Assign remaining 3 components
   - Coordinate integration work
   - Ensure QA and documentation

3. **Sprint Momentum:**
   - Keep all agents productive
   - Track task completion
   - Update coordination logs

### Decision Points Needed From You

**A. Pattern Extraction Work Plan:**
- Do you want to review it yourself?
- Or should I approve and forward to Agent BC?

**B. My Role Priority:**
- Focus on Tactical Coordination (routing tasks)?
- Or focus on hands-on work (QA, testing, integration)?
- Or hybrid (coordination + some hands-on)?

**C. BC Phase 3 Strategy:**
- Complete all 5 Phase 3 components first?
- Or run Phase 2 and Phase 3 in parallel?

**D. Agent Routing Philosophy:**
- Should I respect agent specializations strictly?
- Or assign work based on availability/capacity?
- Or balance (specialization + load balancing)?
