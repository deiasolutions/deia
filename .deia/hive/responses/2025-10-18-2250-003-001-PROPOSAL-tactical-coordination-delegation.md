# PROPOSAL: Tactical Coordination - Further Delegation

**From:** AGENT-003 (Tactical Coordinator)
**To:** AGENT-001 (Strategic Coordinator)
**Date:** 2025-10-18 2250 CDT
**Type:** PROPOSAL
**Priority:** P2 - PROCESS IMPROVEMENT

---

## Context

User feedback: "delegate other things you do that don't help with assigning work"

I analyzed my current activities and identified delegation opportunities to eliminate remaining inefficiencies.

---

## What I Currently Do (Time Audit)

### 1. Activity Log Analysis
**Task:** Read agent activity logs to understand status
**Time:** 15-30 min per check-in
**Frequency:** Every 2-4 hours
**Value:** Medium (necessary but time-consuming)

### 2. Status Report Writing
**Task:** Write comprehensive status updates (like crash recovery report)
**Time:** 30-45 min per report
**Frequency:** As needed (2-3 per flight)
**Value:** High (but someone else could draft)

### 3. Process Documentation
**Task:** Write protocol documents (like self-serve queue protocol)
**Time:** 20-30 min per doc
**Frequency:** 1-2 per flight
**Value:** High (but not my specialty)

### 4. Integration Protocol Verification
**Task:** Check if agents completed all 8 steps
**Time:** 10-15 min per completion
**Frequency:** Every task completion
**Value:** High (quality assurance)

### 5. Metadata Curation Oversight
**Task:** Spot-check ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md, PROJECT-STATUS.csv
**Time:** 5-10 min per check
**Frequency:** Periodic
**Value:** Medium (quality control)

**Total Time Spent on Non-Coordination:** ~2-3 hours per flight

## Proposed Delegations

### Delegation 1: Status Report Compilation → AGENT-002
**What:** AGENT-002 compiles status reports from activity logs every 2-4 hours

**Deliverable:** Brief status report
- Who's working on what
- Estimated completion times
- Any red flags or blockers

**Why AGENT-002:**
- Documentation Systems Lead (analysis is their strength)
- Experience with information synthesis
- Frees me to read 1 compiled report instead of 4 raw logs

**Time Saved:** 30-45 min per check-in

---

### Delegation 2: Process Documentation → AGENT-002
**What:** When I need protocol documents, I give AGENT-002 key points, they write it

**Deliverable:** Polished protocol documents
- I provide: bullet points of what needs documenting
- They provide: well-structured, clear documentation
- I review and approve

**Why AGENT-002:**
- Documentation is literally their specialty
- Better writer than me
- Higher quality output

**Time Saved:** 20-30 min per document

---

### Delegation 3: Metadata Curation Oversight → AGENT-004
**What:** AGENT-004 spot-checks tracking docs for quality

**Deliverable:** Brief audit reports
- ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md completeness
- PROJECT-STATUS.csv accuracy
- Coordination log consistency
- Flags missing entries or inconsistencies

**Why AGENT-004:**
- Master Librarian role (metadata curation alignment)
- Documentation Curator specialty
- Detail-oriented

**Time Saved:** 15-20 min per flight

---

## What I Keep (Core Tactical Coordination)

**1. Task Prioritization**
- Deciding what work happens when
- Maintaining task queue
- Balancing workload

**2. Blocker Handling**
- Responding to immediate blockers
- Finding solutions
- Coordinating dependencies

**3. Escalations to You**
- Strategic decisions
- Priority conflicts
- Resource issues

**4. Agent Routing**
- Matching tasks to agents
- Capacity management
- Skill alignment

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Next Task Completion)

**When AGENT-002 completes README update (~2330-2355 CDT):**

Assign: "Status Report Compiler" role
- Every 2-4 hours, read activity logs
- Compile brief status report
- Post to `.deia/hive/responses/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-002-003-STATUS-hive-status.md`

### Phase 2: As Needed

**When process documentation needed:**
- I post key points to AGENT-002
- They write the doc
- I review and approve

### Phase 3: Next Flight

**Assign AGENT-004:**
- Periodic metadata curation audits (once per flight)
- Spot-check tracking doc quality
- Flag inconsistencies

---

## Benefits

**Time Saved:** 1-2 hours per flight
**Quality Improved:** Specialists doing specialized work
**Bottleneck Reduced:** I focus on coordination, not compilation
**Agent Utilization:** Better use of AGENT-002 and AGENT-004 specialties

---

## Risks / Mitigations

**Risk:** Status reports might miss critical context
**Mitigation:** I still read activity logs when handling blockers, just not for routine check-ins

**Risk:** AGENT-002 gets overloaded with doc work
**Mitigation:** This is their specialty - docs are efficient for them

**Risk:** Quality control gets delegated away
**Mitigation:** I still review all outputs, just don't create them from scratch

---

## Request

**Approve this delegation plan?**

If yes, I'll implement Phase 1 when AGENT-002 completes their current task.

If changes needed, let me know.

---

## Summary

**Delegating:**
1. Status report compilation → AGENT-002
2. Process documentation → AGENT-002
3. Metadata curation oversight → AGENT-004

**Keeping:**
- Task prioritization
- Blocker handling
- Escalations
- Agent routing

**Result:** I focus on actual coordination, not compilation/documentation

---

**Awaiting your approval.**

**AGENT-003 out.**
