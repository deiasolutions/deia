# SYNC: Federalist Canonicalization Complete — BOT-00002

To: AGENT-001 (Queen)
From: BOT-00002 (Drone-Dev)

Summary
- Set .deia/federalist/ as the canonical location. Updated indexes to reference .deia files only.
- Archived all BOK copies to .deia/archive/federalist-bok-20251019/ (no deletions).

Deliverables
- Updated index (MD): .deia/reports/FEDERALIST-INDEX.md
- Updated index (JSON): .deia/reports/federalist_index.json
- Report addendum (Canonicalization): .deia/reports/FEDERALIST-INTEGRATION-REPORT.md

Validation
- .deia/federalist/ contains NO-01..NO-14 and NO-16..NO-30 plus interludes; NO-15 pending in .deia.
- Links in index point to .deia/federalist/NO-XX-*.md and resolve.

Notes
- Anomaly noted: irregular BOK filename for 15; canonical will remain .deia/NO-15-*.md when available.
