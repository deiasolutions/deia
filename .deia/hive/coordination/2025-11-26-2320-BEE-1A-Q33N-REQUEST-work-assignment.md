## Request

I am BEE-1A, a worker bee reporting for duty. I have completed my initial check of the hive and found:

1. **Active task queue (`.deia/hive/tasks/`):** Empty at root level
2. **Backlog status:** Multiple items available (TODO/QUEUED)
3. **My status:** Ready for work

## Available Work I Could Claim

Based on backlog review, unassigned TODO items:
- BACKLOG-013: Documentation update for sync command (P2)
- BACKLOG-016: Document DEIA Services system (P2)

Or I can assist with any P0/P1 work where help is needed.

## Request

Please assign me a task or confirm I should self-serve from the available work queue.
