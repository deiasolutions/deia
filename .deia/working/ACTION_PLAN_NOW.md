# Action Plan - What to Do Right Now

**Two things to accomplish:**
1. Push DEIA to GitHub (public)
2. Set up FBB with DEIA logging (your end-user instance)

---

## Action 1: Push to GitHub (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repo

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `deia`
3. Description: "Development Evidence & Insights Automation - Never lose context, share what you learn"
4. **Public** repo
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Local Repo

```bash
cd C:\Users\davee\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\deiasolutions

# Verify what's going public (should NOT show .deia/, admin/, project_resume.md)
git status

# Add all public files
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial public release

- Conversation logging system (never lose context)
- BOK structure (patterns, platforms, anti-patterns)
- Complete documentation
- Python CLI tool
- Privacy-first architecture
- Constitutional governance

Conversation logging solves the $100/month Claude Code problem:
crashes no longer lose context."

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deia.git

# Push
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 3: Verify

Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deia` and verify:
- âœ… README.md displays nicely
- âœ… `bok/`, `docs/`, `src/` are visible
- âœ… `admin/`, `.deia/`, `project_resume.md` are NOT visible

**Done! Public DEIA exists.**

---

## Action 2: Set Up FBB with DEIA (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Find FBB Location

```bash
# Find where FBB is
find ~ -type d -name "familybondbot" 2>/dev/null | head -1

# Or search manually in OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/
```

**Let's say it's at:** `C:\Users\davee\...\familybondbot`

### Step 2: Create DEIA Workspace in FBB

```bash
cd C:\Users\davee\...\familybondbot

# Create directories
mkdir -p .deia/sessions
mkdir -p .deia/intake

# Copy logger
cp C:\Users\davee\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\deiasolutions\src\deia\logger.py .deia\logger.py

# Add to gitignore (append if .gitignore exists)
echo "" >> .gitignore
echo "# DEIA workspace (private conversation logs)" >> .gitignore
echo ".deia/" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Create FBB START_HERE.md

```bash
cd C:\Users\davee\...\familybondbot

# Create .claude directory if doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude

# Create START_HERE.md
cat > .claude/START_HERE.md << 'EOF'
# Family Bond Bot - Instructions for Claude Code

**Project:** Family Bond Bot - Visitation scheduling platform
**Tech Stack:** [Fill in: Python? Node? React?]
**Current Phase:** [Fill in: Development? Production?]

---

## ðŸ”´ REQUIRED: Log Every Session

**At the end of EVERY conversation, run this:**

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.deia')
from logger import quick_log

quick_log(
    context='Brief description of what we worked on today',
    transcript='[Paste full conversation or reference "See Claude Code history"]',
    decisions=['Key technical decision 1', 'Key technical decision 2'],
    action_items=['What was completed', 'What is still pending'],
    files_modified=['path/to/file1.py', 'path/to/file2.md']
)
```

**Why:** Insurance against crashes. If computer crashes, read `.deia/sessions/latest.md` to recover context.

**Where logs go:** `.deia/sessions/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-conversation.md` (gitignored, private)

---

**Remember: Log EVERY session to .deia/sessions/**
EOF
```

### Step 4: Test Logging

Open Claude Code in FBB project:

```
Claude, read .claude/START_HERE.md

Then log this test conversation:
- Context: "Setting up DEIA conversation logging in FBB"
- Decisions: ["Use DEIA for conversation logging", "Store logs in .deia/sessions/"]
- Files: [".claude/START_HERE.md", ".deia/logger.py", ".gitignore"]
```

Claude should create: `.deia/sessions/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-conversation.md`

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
cd C:\Users\davee\...\familybondbot

# Check log was created
ls .deia/sessions/

# View index
cat .deia/sessions/INDEX.md

# View log
ls .deia/sessions/*.md | head -1 | xargs cat
```

**Done! FBB has DEIA logging.**

---

## Action 3: Update FBB START_HERE.md (Later)

**Fill in the placeholders:**
- Project description
- Tech stack
- Coding standards
- Current work

**This becomes FBB Claude's permanent memory.**

## The Workflow Going Forward

### Daily FBB Work

1. Open Claude Code in FBB
2. Claude reads `.claude/START_HERE.md` (automatic if configured)
3. Work on FBB features
4. At end of session: Log conversation (manual or via instruction)

### Weekly Pattern Extraction

1. Review FBB logs:
   ```bash
   cat .deia/sessions/INDEX.md
   ```

2. Find useful patterns:
   ```
   "Claude, that authentication pattern in session 20251006-* is useful.
    Extract it to .deia/intake/fbb_pattern_auth.md for DEIA submission."
   ```

3. Claude creates sanitized pattern in `.deia/intake/`

### Monthly DEIA Submission

1. Switch to DEIA admin workspace:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\davee\...\deiasolutions
   ```

2. Copy patterns from FBB:
   ```bash
   cp ../familybondbot/.deia/intake/*.md admin/deliberations/
   ```

3. Review as DEIA admin
4. Accept â†’ Copy to `bok/`
5. Push to GitHub

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to run a service?
**A:** No. Just a Python file in each project.

### Q: Does FBB sync with DEIA automatically?
**A:** No. Manual workflow (for now):
- FBB logs â†’ FBB `.deia/intake/`
- You copy â†’ DEIA `admin/deliberations/`
- You review â†’ DEIA `bok/`
- You push â†’ GitHub

### Q: What if I forget to log?
**A:** Context is lost. That's why `.claude/START_HERE.md` instructs Claude to log every session.

### Q: Can I automate this?
**A:** Future feature. For now, proven manual workflow.

## Files to Have Open

**While working in FBB:**
- FBB project in Claude Code
- `.claude/START_HERE.md` (reference)
- `.deia/sessions/INDEX.md` (check logs)

**While doing DEIA admin work:**
- DEIA project in separate Claude Code window
- `admin/deliberations/` (review submissions)
- `bok/` (add accepted patterns)

---

## Summary

**Action 1:** Push deiasolutions â†’ GitHub (10 min)
**Action 2:** Set up FBB with `.deia/` and `.claude/START_HERE.md` (15 min)
**Action 3:** Fill in FBB START_HERE.md details (later)

**Result:**
- âœ… Public DEIA on GitHub
- âœ… FBB logs conversations
- âœ… You can extract patterns
- âœ… You can submit to public DEIA

**Total time:** 25 minutes
