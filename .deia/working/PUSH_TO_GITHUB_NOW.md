# Push DEIA to GitHub - Execute These Commands

**Status:** Ready to push
**Time:** 5 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

1. Create GitHub repo first: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `deia`
   - Description: "Development Evidence & Insights Automation - Never lose context, share what you learn"
   - **Public** repository
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have them)

2. Get your GitHub username ready (replace YOUR_USERNAME below)

---

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Navigate to deiasolutions directory
cd C:\Users\davee\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\deiasolutions

# Verify what's going public (should NOT show .deia/, admin/, project_resume.md)
git status

# If you see files you don't want public, they should be in .gitignore
# Check .gitignore is correct:
cat .gitignore | grep -E "(\.deia|admin|project_resume)"

# Add all files
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial public release: DEIA v1.0

Features:
- Conversation logging system (never lose context again)
- Auto-update to project_resume.md
- BOK structure (patterns, platforms, anti-patterns)
- Privacy-first architecture (local-first, opt-in sharing)
- Trusted submitter support (CFRL)
- Complete documentation (4000+ words)
- VS Code extension spec

Solves: Claude Code loses context on crash. DEIA logs everything locally.

Created post-crash when we lost 3+ hours of work. Never again."

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deia.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Immediate Next Steps (On GitHub)

### 1. Enable GitHub Discussions

### 2. Add GitHub Sponsors

```

2. Commit and push:

## Troubleshooting

**If git push fails with "remote already exists":**
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deia.git
git push -u origin master
```

**If you need to use main instead of master:**
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**If authentication fails:**
- Use GitHub personal access token
- Or set up SSH keys
- See: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication

---

## Done!

Once pushed:
- ‚úÖ DEIA is public
- ‚úÖ Community can see it
- ‚úÖ Ready for FBB setup
- ‚úÖ Can start accepting contributions

**Next: Set up FBB with DEIA**
