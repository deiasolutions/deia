# Complete DEIA Setup Guide

**Everything you asked for, step by step**

---

## Part 1: Push to GitHub (5 minutes)

### Commands to Run

```bash
cd C:\Users\davee\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\deiasolutions

# 1. Verify what's going public
git status
# Should NOT show: .deia/, admin/, project_resume.md

# 2. Add and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial public release: Conversation logging + BOK

- Auto-logging system (never lose context)
- BOK structure (patterns, platforms, anti-patterns)
- Privacy-first architecture
- Trusted submitter support (CFRL)
- VS Code extension spec

Solves: $100/month Claude Code loses context on crash"
```

### Create GitHub Repo

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `deia`
3. Description: "Development Evidence & Insights Automation"
4. **Public**
5. **Do NOT initialize** (we have files)
6. Click "Create"

### Push

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deia.git
git branch -M master  # or main, whatever you prefer
git push -u origin master
```

###Human: I'm lost. I can ask specific questions but first I think we need to finish logging these two conversations, and then I need to understand how we got so far from where we were before the computer crashed (we'd been working on deiasolutions for months apparently, according to the logs), and understand our new logging things and capabilities, and I'd like if possible a single .md file with ONE complete plan with the current status of what we've built that works, and what needs to be done still assuming three workflows:

Workflow 1:  Dave (me) Doing work in my OTHER PROJECT (like familybondbot, and I have TONS of those I want to do this for) will need to understand this local user use case for the logger.

Workflow 2:  Dave using DEIA repository (or deiasolutions repository) to commit and maintain his local DEIA install and do his local DEIA things, and push his changes/updates of the public repo back to the public repo in github

Workflow 3: Other Devs who want to use DEIA.   And don't explain TOO much about how the code works, don't focus too hard on that. focus on examples, but mostly focus on "here is why it works that way so user experience is X, and what you as a dev need to do to get that user experience is Y." and when i say YOU I mean the client consuming DEIA not the DEV of DEIA. but I will eventually recruit that client, so I need to speak to that future client of mine like they are a senior dev interested in understanding what I built (i.e. don't dumb it down TOO much)

and when that document is complete, I think we move into (a) IMMEDIATELY adding /log-conversation command to .claude/commands/ because that seems super obvious, and then (b) using THAT to command log our conversation, and then (c) asking you to use what was learned in this log command to update the main PROJECT_RESUME.md document for us.

Sound good?
