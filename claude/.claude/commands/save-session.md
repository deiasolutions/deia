description: Save current conversation to intake folder with timestamp
---

Please help me save our current conversation to the intake folder:

1. Create a markdown file in `devlogs/intake/` with filename format: `session_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.md`
2. The file should contain:
   - Session metadata (date, time, topics discussed)
   - Full conversation transcript
   - Any key decisions or action items
3. Format it so it's ready for later review and BOK extraction

Note: You'll need to ask me to copy the conversation from the Claude Code UI, or provide guidance on how to capture it.
