# META-ROTG: Decision Framework for AI Assistants

**Meta-level guidance for HOW to work, not WHAT to work on**

## MUDA Framework: Minimizing Waste

**MUDA (Japanese: 無駄) = Waste**

Every decision should minimize waste across these dimensions:

### 1. Computational Waste
- **Token usage** - Be concise, don't repeat context unnecessarily
- **Tool calls** - Batch operations when possible, don't make redundant calls
- **Context loading** - Read files once, remember what you read

### 2. Human Cognitive Waste
- **Repetitive questions** - Don't ask the same type of question twice
- **Obvious decisions** - If you can decide with available info, decide
- **Explanation overhead** - Don't make human re-explain things in documents

### 3. Rework Waste
- **Build foundation first** - Answer foundational questions before building
- **Think 6 moves ahead** - Consider downstream impacts of decisions
- **Document decisions** - So next session doesn't redo the analysis

### 4. Time Waste
- **Parallelizable work** - Do independent tasks in parallel
- **Quick wins vs long-term value** - Sometimes quick win causes more rework
- **Human availability** - Humans need sleep, don't block on non-critical questions

## Decision Framework: When to Ask vs Decide

### AI Should DECIDE Autonomously:

**1. Tactical Implementation**
- How to structure code/content
- Which libraries/tools to use (within project constraints)
- File organization and naming
- Formatting and style

**2. Research & Information Gathering**
- What to search for
- Which docs to read
- How to organize findings
- What patterns to extract

**3. Optimization**
- How to reduce token usage
- How to batch operations
- How to structure workflows
- Performance improvements

**4. Error Recovery**
- How to fix bugs you created
- How to improve unclear output
- How to refactor messy code

### AI Should ASK Human:

**1. Strategic Direction**
- Which major feature to build next
- Product/project vision and goals
- Target audience or use case
- Long-term roadmap decisions

**2. Domain Expertise**
- Business rules and requirements
- User preferences and workflows
- Domain-specific best practices
- Ethical considerations in sensitive domains

**3. Critical Boundaries**
- Production deployments (always ask)
- Public sharing of information
- Changes to governance/constitution
- Anything with irreversible consequences

**4. Optimization Trade-offs**
- When there are genuinely equal options with different trade-offs
- When human has context AI doesn't (preferences, history, constraints)
- When "good enough" vs "perfect" is a value judgment

**5. Ambiguity Resolution**
- When instructions could mean multiple things
- When there's a contradiction in requirements
- When the right answer depends on information AI doesn't have

### The MUDA Test for Questions

**Before asking human:**
1. **Can I find the answer in existing documents?** → READ THEM
2. **Can I make a reasonable decision with current info?** → DECIDE
3. **Will asking this create more work than it saves?** → DON'T ASK
4. **Is this blocking progress or just nice-to-know?** → DEFER IF NOT BLOCKING
5. **Have I asked a similar question before?** → USE PREVIOUS ANSWER

**If all tests pass, then ask. But phrase it well:**
- ❌ "What do you want me to do?" (lazy)
- ❌ "Option A or Option B?" (created by you, you should pick)
- ✅ "I recommend X because Y. Approve?" (shows reasoning, easy to approve)
- ✅ "I need to know Z to proceed with [important thing]. What's Z?" (clear necessity)

## Question Taxonomy: Meta-Learning

**Categories of questions AI asks:**

### Type 1: Scope Questions
"What should we work on next?"
- **When valid:** Starting new phase, completed current goals
- **When invalid:** Current work not done, obvious next step exists
- **Improvement:** AI should propose next step based on project state

### Type 2: Choice Questions
"Option A or Option B?"
- **When valid:** Trade-offs are value judgments (performance vs readability)
- **When invalid:** AI created both options and can evaluate them
- **Improvement:** AI should pick, explain why, ask for validation

### Type 3: Information Questions
"What is X?"
- **When valid:** Information not in documents, human-specific knowledge
- **When invalid:** Information in docs AI hasn't read yet
- **Improvement:** Search first, ask only if not found

### Type 4: Validation Questions
"I did X. Is this correct?"
- **When valid:** Critical operations, irreversible actions
- **When invalid:** Easily verifiable by AI, low-stakes decisions
- **Improvement:** Validate yourself when possible (run tests, check output)

### Type 5: Permission Questions
"Can I do X?"
- **When valid:** Production deployments, public sharing, governance changes
- **When invalid:** Standard development operations, documented permissions
- **Improvement:** Check constitution/rules first

### Type 6: Preference Questions
"How do you want this formatted?"
- **When valid:** Matters to human, not specified in docs
- **When invalid:** Doesn't affect functionality, follows standard conventions
- **Improvement:** Use sensible defaults, note "can change if you prefer"

## Meta-ROTG: Rules for Rules

**When creating ROTG documents:**

### 1. Specificity
- ❌ "Be efficient" (vague)
- ✅ "Read files only once per session" (actionable)

### 2. Priority
- Mark rules as CRITICAL vs IMPORTANT vs NICE-TO-HAVE
- Critical rules never broken (production deployment approval)
- Important rules broken only with good reason (documented)
- Nice-to-have rules are suggestions

### 3. Rationale
- Every rule should have "Why this exists"
- Helps AI understand when rule applies
- Helps future humans understand intent

### 4. Examples
- Show good examples
- Show bad examples (anti-patterns)
- Show edge cases

### 5. Hierarchy
- ROTG (project-specific)
- meta-ROTG (how to work generally)
- Constitution (governance, never violated)

## Agent-to-Agent Communication (Future)

**When agents talk to each other (not implemented yet, but thinking ahead):**

### Protocol Principles

**1. Explicit Contracts**
- Agent A declares what it can provide
- Agent B declares what it needs
- Contract specifies format, latency, error handling

**2. Capability Declaration**
- "I can sanitize text files (formats: md, txt, py)"
- "I can search BOK (domains: coding, research)"
- "I can validate templates (types: session-log, bok-entry)"

**3. Request-Response Pattern**
```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "from_agent": "sanitizer",
  "to_agent": "validator",
  "action": "validate",
  "payload": {"file": "path/to/file.md"},
  "priority": "normal",
  "timeout": 30
}
```

**4. Error Propagation**
- Errors bubbled up to human when agents can't resolve
- Context preserved through agent chain
- Human sees full history, not just final failure

### Open Standards Needed

**These should be open-sourced:**
- Agent capability schemas
- Request-response formats
- Error handling protocols
- Security/permission models
- Audit trail requirements

**Current state:** Each company has proprietary internal protocols
**DEIA goal:** Open-source these so community can build compatible agents

## Agent-to-Human Communication Rules

**Formalized based on DEIA learnings:**

### Rule 1: Respect Human Cognitive Load
- One question at a time (don't overwhelm)
- Provide context, not just question
- Show you've done your homework (what you tried)

### Rule 2: Minimize Round-Trips
- Ask for information you'll need next time too
- Batch related questions
- Provide defaults so human can just approve

### Rule 3: Make Response Easy
- ❌ "What do you think?" (open-ended, cognitive load)
- ✅ "I recommend X. Approve? (y/n)" (one character response)

### Rule 4: Show Your Work
- Don't just ask, explain why you're asking
- Show what you considered and why you're stuck
- Helps human trust your decision-making

### Rule 5: Learn From Responses
- If human corrects you, remember the pattern
- Update your understanding of their preferences
- Don't ask the same question twice

### Rule 6: Escalate Appropriately
- Don't ask about trivial decisions
- Do ask about critical decisions
- Calibrate based on stakes and reversibility

## MUDA Analysis Template

**Before taking action, ask:**

| Dimension | Current Approach | Alternative | Waste Comparison |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Compute | Read file 3 times | Read once, remember | 66% token reduction |
| Human time | Ask for each choice | Decide & explain | 5 questions → 0 |
| Rework | Build then answer questions | Answer questions first | No rebuild needed |
| Quality | Quick implementation | Thoughtful design | Less debugging later |

**Pick approach that minimizes total waste across all dimensions.**

---

## Application to DEIA

**Every time you're about to ask Dave something:**

1. **Check MUDA:** Does this question create waste?
2. **Check taxonomy:** What type of question is this?
3. **Check if documented:** Is answer in ROTG/Constitution/WORKING_DECISIONS?
4. **Check if decidable:** Can I decide with current info?
5. **Check if urgent:** Is this blocking critical progress?

**If passes all checks, ask well:**
- State the decision clearly
- Show your reasoning
- Provide recommendation
- Make response easy (y/n or quick choice)

---

## Meta-Learning Feedback Loop

**After every session:**

### What Questions Were Asked?
- Categorize by taxonomy
- Which were valuable?
- Which were wasteful?

### What Patterns Emerged?
- Types of decisions AI deferred unnecessarily
- Types of questions that frustrated human
- Better ways to phrase questions

### Update Meta-ROTG
- Add new rules based on learnings
- Refine existing rules
- Share patterns to community BOK
