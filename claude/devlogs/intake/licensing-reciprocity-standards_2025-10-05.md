# Licensing, Reciprocity, and Standards Discussion

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** Active brainstorming - critical insights captured

## Core Revelations

### 1. The Archaeological Dig Metaphor

**Dave's insight:** This is like an Egyptian dig with multiple screens.

**What comes out of the ground (inputs):**
1. Domain knowledge (universal coding patterns)
2. Universal procedural knowledge (how any human-AI pair should work)
3. Company-specific procedural knowledge (how Company X wants their devs to work)
4. Personal procedural knowledge (Dave's preferences)
5. PII / meta-PII / behavioral fingerprints
6. Dave's IP (DEIA Solutions business strategy)
7. Employer IP (when consulting for Company X)
8. Pre-existing licensed code (GPL, MIT, etc.)
9. Secrets (credentials, keys, national security)
10. Vendor collaboration insights (Railway performance patterns)

**Multiple stakeholders want different things:**
- Public commons (BOK)
- Individual practitioners (Dave)
- Employers (Company X)
- Hosting vendors (Railway, Vercel)
- National security (government)
- Pre-existing license holders (respect their terms)

**The screening system:** Classification → Sanitization → Routing → Licensing

## 2. RECIPROCITY IS CONSTITUTIONAL (Non-Negotiable)

**Dave's position:**
> "We demand reciprocity. At a minimum we need to have some auditable commitment that organizations make that if they use this they share what they find for humanity."

**Why this matters:**
> "Because as soon as shit starts being collected for profit or private gain, we run the risk of someone breaking the Constitutional protocols and we get a runaway maverick singularity."

**Constitutional principle:** **Reciprocity for the Common Good**

**Implementation:**
- Organizations using DEIA MUST have auditable commitment to share universal knowledge
- This is not optional - it's constitutional
- Prevents private knowledge accumulation that could lead to dangerous AI scenarios

---

## 3. The Licensing Solution

**Dave's breakthrough:**
> "HERE is how we fix that. The shareable knowledge is freely shared. If you want to keep secrets, you hire and pay and compensate the human who thought of it, and license it from them."

**The Model:**
- **Universal knowledge** → BOK → Free (CC BY-SA)
- **Company-specific knowledge** → Company pays/licenses from human creator
- **Economic incentive:** If you want proprietary advantage, compensate the human

**This solves the company IP question:**
- Companies can have secrets
- But they must fairly compensate the humans who create them
- And universal lessons still go to BOK

---

## 4. Standards Bodies Integration

**Dave wants to incorporate:**
- **BABOK** (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge)
- **PMBOK** (Project Management Body of Knowledge)
- **ISO Standards** (international standards)
- **Other standards organizations**

**Potential need:** BABOK-AI, PMBOK-AI, AIBOK
- AI-specific versions of existing professional standards
- Integration with established standards bodies
- International recognition and alignment

**Question for research:** What can we learn from **HuggingFace** model?

---

## 5. Governance Board Role

**Decision authority:**
- Governing board helps determine line between universal knowledge and entity secrets
- This isn't just technical - it's governance
- Prevents individual AI/human pairs from making inconsistent decisions

---

## 6. Meta-PII Concerns (Q3)

**The worry:** Working hours, try-fail cycles, curse frequency
- Can fingerprint individuals
- Can reveal private patterns
- Could be misused

**Railway example (Q4):**
> "Let's give them back the feedback (which they would love to have... how much do we rely on Discord to track our try/fail cycles?)"

**Approach:**
- Protect Railway (vendor)
- But give them valuable aggregated feedback
- Try/fail cycles, performance patterns - they want this data
- Currently tracked ad-hoc on Discord

---

## 7. National Security (Q5)

**Dave's perspective:**
> "Well for darn sure governments need to be protected. But I think in this case, the best protection is universal knowledge, right?"

**Interesting take:**
- Universal knowledge protects national security?
- Opposite of traditional "classification" approach
- Needs more thought

## Licensing Architecture (Emerging)

### Proposed Multi-Layer Licensing:

**Layer 1: DEIA Tools**
- License: MIT/Apache 2.0 (permissive)
- Goal: Maximize adoption
- Anyone can use, modify, distribute

**Layer 2: BOK Content**
- License: CC BY-SA 4.0 (ShareAlike)
- Goal: Ensure improvements are shared back
- If you improve shared knowledge, you must share improvements

**Layer 3: Constitutional Framework**
- License: CC BY-ND (No Derivatives)
- Goal: Preserve core principles
- Can share, but can't modify without governance approval

**Layer 4: Privacy Requirements**
- License: Non-waivable constitutional rights
- Goal: Absolute protection
- Cannot be opted out of

**Layer 5: Reciprocity Covenant**
- License: Required commitment for DEIA usage
- Goal: Auditable promise to share universal knowledge
- Violation = constitutional breach

## Open Questions

1. **Standards alignment:** How to integrate with BABOK, PMBOK, ISO?
2. **HuggingFace lessons:** What can we learn from their model?
3. **Reciprocity enforcement:** How to make commitments auditable?
4. **Governing board:** Structure, authority, decision-making process
5. **National security:** Is universal knowledge actually better protection?
6. **Vendor agreements:** Template for Railway, Vercel, etc.
7. **Meta-PII:** Delete entirely or anonymize and aggregate?

---

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. Add "Common Good" principle to constitution
2. Add reciprocity requirement (non-waivable)
3. Design multi-layer licensing architecture
4. Research standards bodies
5. Research HuggingFace model
6. Define governance board role in knowledge classification
7. Create vendor collaboration agreement template
