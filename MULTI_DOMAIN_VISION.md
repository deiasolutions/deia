# DEIA Multi-Domain Vision

**The same problems exist everywhere humans work with AI.**

---

## Why Multi-Domain Matters

DEIA starts with software development because:
- AI coding tools are most mature (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor)
- Dave works here (dogfooding validates the architecture)
- Fast iteration and feedback
- Lower stakes for early mistakes

But **the problems DEIA solves are universal:**

- Conversations lost to crashes
- Knowledge locked in vendor servers
- Solutions rediscovered repeatedly
- Can't share insights without privacy violations
- No cross-tool standardization
- Community knowledge fragmented

**These problems plague EVERY domain where humans collaborate with AI.**

---

## The Architecture Is Domain-Agnostic

**Core DEIA capabilities work everywhere:**

1. **Conversation logging** - Browser-based or IDE-based AI = same capture mechanism
2. **Privacy-safe sharing** - Every domain has secrets (company IP, patient data, legal privilege)
3. **Cross-platform preferences** - Researchers switch tools just like developers do
4. **Community knowledge commons** - Patterns emerge from aggregated evidence
5. **Vendor accountability** - Bug reports and workarounds matter in all domains

**The tech stack doesn't care what domain you work in.**

Browser extension logs Claude.ai conversations whether you're:
- Debugging Python async bugs
- Reviewing medical literature
- Researching case law
- Planning curriculum
- Analyzing business strategy

**Same tool. Different knowledge domain.**

## Target Domains (Post-Coding Proof of Concept)

### 1. Scientific Research

**Current problems:**
- Literature review sessions lost to browser crashes
- Experimental design patterns not shared across labs
- AI-assisted hypothesis generation rediscovered repeatedly
- Can't share research workflows without exposing unpublished data

**DEIA solution:**
- Log research sessions (literature review, data analysis, hypothesis generation)
- Share anonymized research patterns (successful experimental designs, analysis approaches)
- Domain-specific sanitization (strip unpublished findings, grant details, collaborator names)
- Cross-institution knowledge sharing (what works in molecular biology, physics, social science)

**Governance needs:**
- IRB compliance (human subjects research)
- Pre-publication protections
- Academic authorship norms
- Reproducibility standards

**Timeline:** Pilot with 1-2 research groups after coding platform validated

---

### 2. Healthcare & Medicine

**Current problems:**
- Clinical decision support sessions not logged (no audit trail)
- Diagnostic patterns not shared across practitioners
- AI-assisted treatment planning happens in black boxes
- HIPAA makes sharing nearly impossible

**DEIA solution:**
- Log clinical AI sessions (differential diagnosis, treatment planning, literature lookup)
- Aggregate anonymized clinical decision patterns (what works for condition X)
- HIPAA-compliant sanitization (strip all patient identifiers)
- Evidence-based community knowledge (peer-reviewed by medical professionals)

**Governance needs:**
- HIPAA compliance (mandatory)
- Medical ethics review
- Clinical validation requirements
- Liability considerations

**Critical:** Higher stakes than coding. Mistakes harm patients. Requires medical domain experts on governance board.

**Timeline:** After research domain validated. Possibly 2027+.

---

### 3. Legal Practice

**Current problems:**
- Case research sessions lost (hours of AI-assisted legal research gone)
- Legal strategy patterns not shared (every lawyer reinvents the wheel)
- Can't share AI legal work without violating attorney-client privilege
- No audit trail for AI-assisted legal decisions

**DEIA solution:**
- Log legal research sessions (case law, precedent analysis, brief drafting)
- Share anonymized legal patterns (successful arguments, research strategies)
- Attorney-client privilege sanitization (strip client names, case details, specific facts)
- Jurisdictional pattern libraries (what works in federal vs state, civil vs criminal)

**Governance needs:**
- Attorney-client privilege protection (non-negotiable)
- Bar association ethics compliance
- Jurisdictional variations
- Professional liability insurance considerations

**Timeline:** After healthcare validated. Requires legal domain experts.

---

### 4. Education & Curriculum Design

**Current problems:**
- Lesson planning sessions with AI not logged (no institutional memory)
- Successful teaching strategies not shared across institutions
- AI-assisted curriculum design rediscovered by every educator
- Student privacy concerns prevent sharing

**DEIA solution:**
- Log curriculum planning sessions (lesson design, assessment creation, pedagogy research)
- Share teaching patterns (what works for concept X, age group Y, learning style Z)
- FERPA-compliant sanitization (strip student names, grades, personal info)
- Cross-institutional knowledge (K-12, university, professional training)

**Governance needs:**
- FERPA compliance (student privacy)
- Pedagogical validation
- Age-appropriate content review
- Cultural sensitivity

**Timeline:** Lower stakes than healthcare/legal. Could pilot alongside research domain.

---

### 5. Business Strategy & Analysis

**Current problems:**
- Market analysis sessions with AI lost to crashes
- Competitive strategy insights locked in individual heads
- AI-assisted business planning rediscovered repeatedly
- Can't share insights without exposing company secrets

**DEIA solution:**
- Log strategy sessions (market analysis, competitive research, planning)
- Share anonymized business patterns (what works for market entry, pricing, growth)
- Trade secret sanitization (strip company names, financials, proprietary data)
- Industry-specific knowledge (SaaS playbooks, manufacturing patterns, retail strategies)

**Governance needs:**
- Trade secret protection
- Antitrust compliance (can't facilitate collusion)
- Fiduciary duty considerations
- Competitive intelligence ethics

**Timeline:** After initial domains validated. Business users may fund development.

## Domain-Specific Requirements

### What Changes Per Domain

**1. Sanitization rules:**
- Healthcare: HIPAA identifiers (names, dates, locations, medical record numbers)
- Legal: Attorney-client details (client names, case facts, settlement amounts)
- Research: Unpublished findings (data, hypotheses, grant sources)
- Education: Student info (names, grades, disabilities, family details)
- Business: Trade secrets (financials, customer lists, strategies)

**2. Governance boards:**
- Healthcare: Medical doctors, bioethicists, HIPAA experts
- Legal: Practicing attorneys, ethics professors, bar association reps
- Research: Scientists, IRB chairs, research integrity officers
- Education: Teachers, administrators, education researchers
- Business: Executives, strategists, antitrust lawyers

**3. Validation standards:**
- Healthcare: Peer review by medical professionals, clinical validation
- Legal: Bar association ethics review, jurisdictional compliance

## Why This Matters

**AI is reaching every domain of human activity.**

We need shared knowledge about what works in human-AI collaboration that:
- Respects privacy (domain-specific protections)
- Prevents vendor extraction (community ownership)
- Enables learning (aggregated patterns)
- Maintains sovereignty (you control your data)
- Scales sustainably (proven governance)

**DEIA is that infrastructure.**

Starting with coding to prove it works.

Expanding to all domains because humanity needs it.

**This is infrastructure for human flourishing in the AI era.**
