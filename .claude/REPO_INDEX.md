## Working/Private (Gitignored)

**Repo-Level Private (Dave's personal workspace):**
- `.private/` - Private docs, notes, experiments
  - `.private/docs/` - Documents with PII or strategic info
  - `.private/logs/` - Private conversation logs
  - `.private/README.md` - Usage guide

**Project-Level Private (per-user workspace):**
- `.deia/private/` - Every user's private space
  - `.deia/private/drafts/` - Pre-sanitization submissions
  - `.deia/private/logs/` - Unsanitized conversation logs
  - `.deia/private/notes/` - Personal project notes
  - `.deia/private/README.md` - Usage guide
  - `.deia/SANITIZATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Submission guidelines

**Other Gitignored:**
- `admin/` - Dave's backlog, decisions, ideas
- `.deia/sessions/` - Conversation logs
- `docs/backlog/` - WIP features

**Don't commit these. Don't reference in public docs.**

---

## Files to Ignore/Archive

**Redundant (covered by QUICKSTART.md):**
- `CONVERSATION_LOGGING_QUICKSTART.md` - Superseded by QUICKSTART.md
- `DEIA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Superseded by MEMORY_SETUP.md

**Stale:**
- `BOK_MOVED.md` - Delete (BOK is here, not moved)
- `docs/how-to-save-logs.md` - Redundant with QUICKSTART

**Unclear:**
- `docs/ditto-tracking.md` - What is this?

---

## Decision Rules for Claude

### When User Asks "How do I install DEIA?"
→ Reference `QUICKSTART.md` ONLY
→ Don't show MEMORY_HIERARCHY or technical details

### When User Asks "How does memory work?"
→ Show `DEIA_MEMORY_SETUP.md` simple path
→ Link to MEMORY_HIERARCHY for advanced

### When Working on Code
→ Read `ROADMAP.md` to know what's working vs not
→ Check `src/deia/logger.py` for current implementation
→ Don't assume features work (check ROADMAP first)

### When User Reports Bug
→ Use `gh issue create --repo deiasolutions/deia`
→ Follow template in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### When Confused About Scope
→ Ask Dave: "Should I focus on X or Y?"
→ Don't try to do everything at once

---

## Simplification Needed

**Too many overlapping docs:**
- QUICKSTART vs CONVERSATION_LOGGING_QUICKSTART vs INTEGRATION_GUIDE
- MEMORY_SETUP vs MEMORY_HIERARCHY (merge into ONE with simple path first)

**Recommendation:**
1. Merge memory docs into one (simple at top, advanced at bottom)
2. Delete redundant quickstarts
3. Archive stale docs to `docs/archive/`
4. Keep root-level simple (5-6 files max)

---

## Summary

**EVERY SESSION START (new or resumed):**
1. Read `.claude/STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md` - **ALWAYS FIRST**
2. Read this index (navigation)
3. Read `ROADMAP.md` (know what works)
4. Check `.deia/config.json` auto-log status

**When Dave asks about process:**
- Admin review? → `docs/SUBMISSION_WORKFLOW.md`
- Dev standards? → `docs/DEV-PRACTICES-SUMMARY.md`
- How to install? → `QUICKSTART.md`
- **Don't search - check index first**

**Reference when needed:**
- Memory setup docs
- Contributing guide
- Specific code files

**Ignore unless Dave says:**
- `admin/`
- `.deia/` (except config.json)
- Governance deep dives
- BOK patterns (separate concern)

**Focus:** Help users install and use DEIA simply. Don't overwhelm with 119 files.

## Index Maintenance

**Update this index:**
- ✅ When creating new docs
- ✅ When moving/renaming files
- ✅ Weekly during active development
- ✅ Before major releases

**Check index accuracy:**
```bash
deia doctor index  # (planned command)
```

**Manual check:**
- Are all new docs listed?
- Are paths correct?
- Are descriptions accurate?
- Remove deleted files
