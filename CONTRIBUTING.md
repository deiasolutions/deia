# Contributing to DEIA

**Thank you for helping build collective intelligence for AI collaboration.**

---

## Quick Start

**Three ways to contribute:**

1. **Share Patterns** - Submit useful patterns from your work
2. **Improve Code** - Enhance the DEIA toolkit
3. **Write Docs** - Help others understand and use DEIA

---

## How to Contribute Patterns (BOK)

### Step 1: Log Your Work

Use DEIA conversation logging:

```bash
deia log conversation
```

Or manually create logs in `.deia/sessions/`

### Step 2: Identify Shareable Patterns

**What makes a good pattern:**
- ‚úÖ Universally useful (not project-specific)
- ‚úÖ Actionable (others can apply it)
- ‚úÖ Validated (you've proven it works)
- ‚úÖ Clear (easy to understand)

**Examples:**
- "Test AI changes before asking human to test"
- "Railway HTTPS redirect middleware pattern"
- "How to structure AI decision-making"

**Not patterns:**
- ‚ùå Project-specific code
- ‚ùå "It depends" without guidance
- ‚ùå Theoretical ideas (not tested)

### Step 3: Extract Pattern

Create a markdown file following the BOK template:

```markdown
---
id: unique-slug
date: 2025-10-06
platform: claude-code
category: pattern
confidence: validated
sources: 1
---

# Pattern: [Descriptive Name]

## Problem
What problem does this solve?

## Solution
How to solve it (step-by-step if complex)

## Context
When to use this pattern (and when NOT to)

## Example
Code, conversation, or concrete example

## Validation
How you know it works

## Related
Links to related patterns or anti-patterns
```

### Step 4: Sanitize

**CRITICAL: Remove sensitive information**

**Must remove:**
- Names, emails, usernames ‚Üí `[Name]`, `User`, `Developer`
- Company names ‚Üí `Company X`, `Organization`
- Internal URLs ‚Üí `example.com`, `internal.com`
- API keys ‚Üí `[REDACTED]` or `YOUR_API_KEY`
- Passwords, tokens ‚Üí `[REDACTED]`
- Proprietary code ‚Üí Generic examples only
- Client information ‚Üí `Client`, `Customer`

**Use sanitization tool:**
```bash
deia sanitize pattern.md
```

**Then manually review** - automation can't catch everything.

### Step 5: Submit

**Option A: Pull Request** (preferred when public repo exists)

```bash
# Fork the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deia.git
cd deia

# Create branch
git checkout -b pattern/your-pattern-name

# Add your pattern to appropriate category
# bok/patterns/[category]/your-pattern.md
# bok/platforms/[platform]/your-pattern.md
# bok/anti-patterns/your-antipattern.md

# Commit
git add bok/
git commit -m "Add pattern: Your Pattern Name"

# Push and create PR
git push origin pattern/your-pattern-name
# Then create PR on GitHub
```

**Option B: Issue submission** (if unsure about PR)

1. Go to [Issues](https://github.com/deiasolutions/deia/issues)
2. Create new issue: "Pattern Submission: [Name]"
3. Paste sanitized pattern in issue body
4. Maintainers will review and add to BOK

**Option C: Email** (for sensitive discussions)

Send to: contact@deiasolutions.org (coming soon)

### Step 6: Review Process

**What happens:**
1. Maintainer reviews submission
2. Checks sanitization (no PII, secrets, IP)
3. Verifies pattern is universal
4. Tests if applicable
5. Accepts ‚Üí merges to BOK
6. Rejects ‚Üí explains why with suggestions

**Timeline:** 1-7 days typically

## How to Contribute Code

### Areas Needing Help

**High priority:**
- Improved sanitization detection
- Automated pattern extraction from logs
- Web dashboard for BOK search
- Integration tests
- Platform integrations (Cursor, Copilot)

**Medium priority:**
- CLI improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- Example projects
- MCP server integration

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/deiasolutions/deia.git
cd deia

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Run linter
ruff check src/
```

### Code Standards

**Style:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings (Google style)
- Keep functions small and focused

**Testing:**
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain 80%+ coverage
- Test edge cases

**Documentation:**
- Update docs for user-facing changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update CHANGELOG.md

### Submitting Code

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: Description"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

**PR checklist:**
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Code follows style guide
- [ ] No secrets or PII in code

## How to Contribute Documentation

### Documentation Needs

**Always needed:**
- Clearer explanations
- More examples
- Troubleshooting guides
- Video tutorials (link to external)

**Process:**

1. Find docs to improve (in `docs/`)
2. Make changes
3. Submit PR with `docs:` prefix
4. Example: `docs: Improve sanitization guide with examples`
