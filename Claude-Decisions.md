# Claude Autonomous Decisions Log

**Purpose:** Record decisions made by Claude when given autonomy to proceed without explicit user input.

**Date:** 2025-10-09

---

## Decision 1: Update REPO_INDEX for New Private Structure

**Context:** Created `.private/` and `.deia/private/` directories but REPO_INDEX.md doesn't mention them.

**Decision:** Add private directory documentation to REPO_INDEX.md under "Working/Private (Gitignored)" section.

**Rationale:** Index should be comprehensive. Users (and future Claude sessions) need to know these directories exist and their purpose.

**Alternative considered:** Leave it out since it's private. Rejected because the README files in those dirs explain usage, and index should point to them.

---

## Decision 2: Commit Message Strategy

**Context:** Need to commit PII fixes and privacy infrastructure separately for clear git history.

**Decision:** Create 2 commits:
1. "Fix PII: Replace full name with pseudonym in public docs"
2. "Add privacy infrastructure: .private/ and .deia/private/ directories"

**Rationale:** Separates PII remediation (critical) from infrastructure (enhancement). Makes git history clearer for audit purposes.

**Alternative considered:** Single commit. Rejected because combining unrelated changes makes history harder to review.

---

## Decision 3: Do Not Update Private Briefing

**Context:** CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md is now in `.private/docs/` and was updated earlier with business model clarification.

**Decision:** Leave it as-is. It's already current and doesn't need further updates.

**Rationale:** File is private and current. No need to modify it during this autonomous work session.

---

## Decision 4: Update REPO_INDEX Priority

**Context:** REPO_INDEX.md says CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md is at `docs/CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md` but it's moved.

**Decision:** Update REPO_INDEX to reflect new location: `.private/docs/CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEFING.md` (Note: private, not in git)

**Rationale:** Index must be accurate. Future sessions need to know where to find this file.

---

## Decision 5: Documentation of Changes Strategy

**Context:** Need to document today's work for resumption.

**Decision:** Create `WORK_SESSION_2025-10-09.md` in `.private/docs/` with:
- All changes made
- Privacy verification results
- Next steps for development
- Resume plan for future sessions

**Rationale:** Comprehensive record in private space. Dave can review without PII concerns. Future Claude sessions can read for context.

---

## Decision 6: Git Commit Scope

**Context:** Many untracked files exist (new .claude docs, new root docs, etc.)

**Decision:** Commit only:
- PII fixes (modified files)
- Privacy infrastructure (.gitignore changes, project_resume.md, startup files with reminders)
- DO NOT commit all new docs yet (they need review)

**Rationale:** Focus on what Dave explicitly asked for (privacy). New docs should be reviewed before committing to avoid clutter.

*This file will be committed to git so future sessions know what decisions were made autonomously.*
