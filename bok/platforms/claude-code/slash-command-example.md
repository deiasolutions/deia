# Log This Conversation

**Purpose:** Save this Claude Code conversation to `.deia/sessions/` - Insurance against crashes.

## Instructions for Claude

Use the conversation logger to save this session:

```python
from src.deia.logger import ConversationLogger

logger = ConversationLogger()
log_file = logger.create_session_log(
    context='Brief description of what we worked on',
    transcript='Key moments and full context from this conversation',
    decisions=[
        'Key decision 1',
        'Key decision 2',
        # ... all major decisions
    ],
    action_items=[
        'COMPLETED: Task 1',
        'COMPLETED: Task 2',
        'PENDING: Task 3',
        # ... all tasks
    ],
    files_modified=[
        'path/to/file1.py (what changed)',
        'path/to/file2.md (what changed)',
        # ... all files
    ],
    next_steps='What should happen in the next session',
    status='Completed'  # or 'Active' if session ongoing
)

print(f"âœ… Conversation logged: {log_file}")
print(f"ðŸ“‹ Index: .deia/sessions/INDEX.md")
print(f"ðŸ“„ Resume: project_resume.md (auto-updated)")
```

**Auto-updates:**
- Creates log in `.deia/sessions/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-conversation.md`
- Updates `.deia/sessions/INDEX.md`
- Updates `project_resume.md` with summary

**Confirm to user:** Show the created log file path.
