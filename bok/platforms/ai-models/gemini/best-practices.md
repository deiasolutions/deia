# Gemini Best Practices

**What makes Gemini a rock star**

## 1. Massive Context Window (1M Tokens)

Gemini 1.5 Pro supports 1 million token context - largest available.

**Pattern:**
- Paste entire codebases at once
- Upload multiple large documents
- Ask cross-file refactoring questions
- Analyze entire repositories

**Why it works:**
- 1M tokens â‰ˆ 750,000 words
- Can process multiple books simultaneously
- Maintains coherence across massive context

**Example use case:**
```
Upload: 50 Python files (entire microservice)
Prompt: "Identify all SQL injection vulnerabilities across this codebase"
Gemini: Analyzes all files, finds issues, shows context
```

**When to choose Gemini over Claude/GPT:**
- Need more than 200K tokens (Claude limit)
- Whole-project analysis
- Multiple document synthesis

## 2. Multimodal Excellence (Vision + Text)

Gemini excels when combining images, diagrams, and text.

**Pattern:**
- Upload UI mockup + describe functionality
- Provide architecture diagram + ask for implementation
- Screenshot of error + request debugging help
- Diagram + code generation

**Why it works:**
- Native multimodal training (not bolted-on)
- Understands visual context deeply
- Generates code matching visual designs

**Example:**
```
Input: Screenshot of dashboard UI + "Implement this in React"
Gemini: Generates components with correct layout, spacing, colors
Result: Matches visual design accurately
```

**Better than Claude/GPT because:**
- Claude/GPT vision capabilities more limited
- Gemini trained jointly on vision+text from start

## 3. Code Execution Capability

Gemini can execute Python code internally and show results.

**Pattern:**
- "Write this function AND test it with these inputs"
- Request data analysis with actual computation
- Ask for validation of mathematical claims
- Generate + execute test cases

**Why it works:**
- Gemini runs code in sandbox
- Sees actual output
- Catches bugs before you do

**Example:**
```
Prompt: "Write a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
         Test it with n=10 and show the result."

Gemini:
1. Writes function
2. Executes with n=10
3. Shows output: [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
4. Validates correctness
```

**Claude/GPT can't do this** - they can only generate code, not run it.

## 4. Fast Flash Model for Speed

Gemini 1.5 Flash optimized for speed without sacrificing too much quality.

**Pattern:**
- Rapid prototyping iterations
- Simple code generation
- Quick Q&A during development
- Cost-sensitive applications

**Benchmark:**
- Flash: ~1-2 seconds
- Pro: ~2-4 seconds
- Claude: ~4-6 seconds
- GPT-4: ~3-5 seconds

**When to choose Flash:**
- Speed critical
- Task well-defined and simple
- Budget constraints

## 5. Strong at Structured Data Extraction

Gemini excels at extracting structured data from unstructured sources.

**Pattern:**
- Upload document/image with tables
- Request JSON extraction
- Parse receipts, invoices, forms
- Extract data from screenshots

**Why it works:**
- Multimodal understanding
- Strong at recognizing patterns
- Reliable JSON output

**Example:**
```
Input: Photo of restaurant receipt
Prompt: "Extract items, prices, and total as JSON"
Gemini: {"items": [...], "total": 45.67, "tax": 3.21}
```

## 6. Grounding with Google Search

Gemini can ground responses in real-time Google Search results.

**Pattern:**
- Ask about current events
- Request latest documentation
- Verify facts in real-time
- Get up-to-date pricing/availability

**Why it works:**
- Integration with Google Search
- Reduces hallucination
- Provides sources

**Example:**
```
Prompt: "What's the latest version of React and what are the new features?"
Gemini: [Searches Google] "React 18.3.1 released Oct 2024. New features: ..."
```

**Claude/GPT don't have this** (without plugins/tools).

## When NOT to Use Gemini

**Choose other models when:**

1. **Need ethical reasoning** - Claude better at nuanced ethical considerations
2. **Iterative refinement** - Claude maintains conversation context better
3. **Security review** - Claude's Constitutional AI more reliable
4. **IDE integration** - Copilot better for inline suggestions

## Gemini Model Selection

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Gemini 1.5 Pro | Massive context, multimodal, code execution |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash | Speed-critical tasks, cost-sensitive |
| Gemini 1.0 Pro | Legacy support (prefer 1.5) |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Context Window Cost
1M token context is expensive.

**Mitigation:**
- Use Flash for smaller contexts
- Only upload what's necessary
- Monitor token usage

### 2. Over-Reliance on Vision
Not all visual tasks work well.

**Mitigation:**
- Test with your specific image types
- Provide text descriptions as backup
- Verify visual interpretations

### 3. Code Execution Limitations
Sandbox has restrictions.

**Mitigation:**
- No network access in sandbox
- No file system access
- Can't install packages
- Simple computations only

## Pro Tips

### Maximizing Context Window
```
Structure large context dumps:
1. Index/table of contents first
2. Reference structure in queries
3. Use clear file separators
```

### Multimodal Prompting
```
Best results:
- High-resolution images
- Clear diagrams
- Text description + image together
- Specify what to focus on in image
```

### Code Execution
```
Request format:
"Write [function] and execute it with [inputs] to verify correctness"

Gemini will:
1. Generate code
2. Run it
3. Show output
4. Validate
```
