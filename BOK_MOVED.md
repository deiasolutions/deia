# Book of Knowledge Has Moved

The DEIA Book of Knowledge now lives in a separate repository:

**https://github.com/deiasolutions/deia-bok**

## Why?

To allow the community patterns to scale independently without bloating the main repository.

**Main repo (`deia`):**
- CLI tool
- VSCode extension
- Documentation
- Core infrastructure

**BOK repo (`deia-bok`):**
- Community-contributed patterns
- Platform-specific solutions
- Conversation logs
- Anti-patterns

## How to Access

### Clone BOK separately
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deiasolutions/deia-bok.git
```

### Search via CLI
```bash
deia bok search "railway deployment"
```

### Browse on GitHub
https://github.com/deiasolutions/deia-bok
