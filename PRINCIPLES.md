# DEIA Principles

**Why DEIA exists and how we operate**

---

## Our Purpose

DEIA helps developers capture and share knowledge for the common good.

When you solve a problem with AI assistance, that solution has value. AI companies learn from these interactions on their side. DEIA lets you capture and share that knowledge on your side - not for profit, but to help other developers and advance the field.

**We believe knowledge shared freely makes everyone better.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Share for the Common Good

Knowledge belongs in the commons, not locked behind walls.

**We commit to:**
- Sharing development patterns openly
- Building a knowledge base accessible to all
- No paywalls, no data selling, no exclusive access
- Community governance over corporate control

**Why:** Collective knowledge advances faster than proprietary knowledge. We all benefit when we share what we learn.

---

### 2. Build Sustainably

Consider long-term impact, not just immediate results.

**We commit to:**
- Minimizing computational waste
- Documenting decisions so others can learn from them
- Not creating technical debt for future maintainers
- Choosing patterns that last over quick hacks

**Why:** We're building for years, not quarters. Good patterns compound; bad patterns burden future developers.

---

### 3. Center Human Flourishing

Technology should serve people, especially those often left behind.

**We commit to:**
- Accessibility in our tools and documentation
- Considering impact on vulnerable communities
- Respecting privacy and dignity
- Supporting multiple languages and contexts

**Why:** If our tools only work for the privileged, we're not serving the common good.

---

### 4. Restore, Don't Extract

Leave codebases, communities, and ecosystems better than you found them.

**We commit to:**
- Giving back to open source libraries we use
- Reporting bugs and sharing workarounds responsibly
- Supporting maintainers (time, money, appreciation)
- Repairing harm when we make mistakes

**Why:** We stand on the shoulders of those who shared before us. We owe them - and those who come after - the same generosity.

---

### 5. Defensive Security Only

We help you protect, not attack.

**We accept:**
- Security tools for your own systems
- Detection rules for malicious behavior
- Vulnerability reports after patches are available
- Patterns that enhance privacy and safety

**We reject:**
- Offensive hacking techniques
- Credential harvesting at scale
- Exploits for still-vulnerable systems
- Tools designed to harm or oppress

**Why:** Freedom isn't license to harm. We build for flourishing, not destruction.

---

## What This Means in Practice

### For Contributors

When sharing patterns:
- Consider: Does this help or harm?
- Document: Why did you choose this approach?
- Minimize: Don't include unnecessary complexity
- Respect: Privacy, copyright, terms of service
- Give back: Report issues to library maintainers

### For Maintainers

When reviewing contributions:
- Prioritize: Human impact over technical cleverness
- Question: Long-term sustainability
- Enforce: Security and privacy boundaries
- Support: Contributors learning to do better

### For Users

When using DEIA patterns:
- Understand: Context and tradeoffs
- Adapt: To your specific needs
- Share back: Improvements and learnings
- Respect: Licenses and legal boundaries

---

## Boundaries

### Things We Won't Accept

**Harm to life:**
- Methods to harm humans or animals
- Weapon designs
- Mass casualty techniques
- Torture methods

**Privacy violations:**
- Exposing personal data
- Credential theft patterns
- Deanonymization techniques
- Unauthorized surveillance

**Malicious security:**
- Offensive hacking tools
- Exploits before patches exist
- TOS violations designed to harm vendors
- Tools for harassment or abuse

**These boundaries are non-negotiable.**

---

### Things That Need Review

Some patterns require case-by-case evaluation:

**Terms of Service conflicts:**
- Is this fixing a bug or exploiting a vendor?
- Is this interoperability or theft of service?
- Is this accessibility or circumvention?

**Dual-use technology:**
- Can this be weaponized?
- What safeguards should we include?
- Does benefit outweigh risk?

**Process:** Community discussion → Legal review if needed → Decision with published rationale

---

## Open Source Library Feedback

We use many libraries. We should give back.

**When you hit a bug or find a workaround:**
1. DEIA captures it in the conversation log
2. You can share it with maintainers (deduplicated, contextualized)
3. Maintainers get useful feedback
4. Community gets pattern in DEIA BOK
5. Everyone benefits

**This is respectful contribution:**
- Not spam (deduplicated across users)
- Not demands (maintainers choose what to fix)
- Not exploitation (helping them improve)
- Not data extraction (with their consent)

See `docs/vendor-feedback-channel.md` for details.

---

## Balance, Not Adversity

AI vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) provide incredible tools. We're grateful for them.

But there's an asymmetry:
- They see all activity on their platforms
- They learn from our problem-solving
- They can monetize those insights

**DEIA creates balance:**
- We capture our patterns too
- We share with each other
- We build collective knowledge

**This isn't anti-AI. This is pro-developer.**

We're not fighting vendors. We're ensuring developers also benefit from the knowledge we create.

---

## Governance

### Decision-Making

- **Consensus** preferred for most decisions
- **Community vote** when consensus fails (>60% participation, >75% approval)
- **Maintainer discretion** for security/legal urgency
- **Transparency** in all decisions (rationale published)

### Changes to Principles

1. Proposal published with rationale
2. 30-day community comment period
3. Discussion and iteration
4. Vote if controversial
5. Update with changelog

### Accountability

- Any member can report violations
- Review within 24 hours for urgent issues
- Actions taken with transparency
- Appeal process available
- Focus on education over punishment for good-faith mistakes

---

## Long-Term Thinking

Good patterns outlive their creators.

**We ask:**
- Will this matter in 5 years? 10 years?
- What debt are we creating for future developers?
- What would we want to inherit from those before us?
- Are we building foundations or hacks?

**We commit:**
- Documentation that ages well
- Patterns that remain useful
- Decisions explained so others understand why
- Gratitude for those who built before us
- Responsibility to those who build after us

---

## Living Document

These principles will evolve as we learn.

What we won't change:
- Commitment to common good
- Prohibition on harm
- Transparency in decision-making
- Community governance

What we'll improve:
- How we implement these principles
- How we handle edge cases
- How we support contributors
- How we give back to open source

**We're figuring this out together. Your feedback makes us better.**

---

## Summary

**DEIA exists to:**
- Capture developer knowledge
- Share it for the common good
- Build sustainable, accessible tools
- Give back to open source
- Create balance in the AI ecosystem

**We do this by:**
- Logging conversations with AI (with your consent)
- Building a Body of Knowledge from shared patterns
- Respecting privacy, security, and human dignity
- Maintaining clear boundaries on harm
- Thinking long-term

**Join us in building something that lasts.**
