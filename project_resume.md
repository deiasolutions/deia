# DEIA Project Resume

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Claude Code MUST read this file at the start of EVERY session.**

**⚠️ DO NOT SKIM. Follow ALL instructions below. They exist because you fail without them.**

---

## Step 1: Read These Files (IN ORDER, COMPLETELY)

Execute these reads **before doing anything else:**

1. **`.claude/STARTUP.md`** - **EXECUTE STARTUP ACTIONS** (auto-log status notification)
2. **`.claude/STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md`** - Follow every step in the checklist
3. **`.claude/REPO_INDEX.md`** - Navigation guide (where to find things)
4. **`.claude/INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Auto-logging behavior and breakpoints
5. **`~/.deia/dave/preferences.md`** - Dave's preferences (TDD, communication, etc.)
6. **`ROADMAP.md`** - What actually works vs what's infrastructure-only

**These are NOT optional. Read them completely. Don't skim.**

---

## Step 2: Check Configuration

```bash
cat .deia/config.json
```

**If `auto_log: true`:** Start logging at breakpoints (see INSTRUCTIONS.md for when)

**If `auto_log: false`:** Something is wrong - it should be `true` in DEIA projects

## Step 3: Review Latest Session

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14T16:57:03.690465
### [2025-10-14 16:57] 20251014-165703690465-conversation
**Context:** Efemera The Game pivot + v0.1 build + v0.2 spec.
Built Drone-Lite drones + orchestrator; created flappy egg; pivoted to forward-facing space shooter.
Playable v0.1 vertical scroller scaffolded (LR + shoot). Added run_game.bat. Planned v0.2 features.

**Key decisions:**
- Adopt nested eggs: Outer -> Egg-01/02/03
- Ship v0.1 prototype quickly, iterate in small patches
- Pivot POV: looking into space, enemies approach
- ... and 2 more

**Files modified:**
- docs/projects/Efemera-The-Game-Outer-Egg-v0.1.md
- docs/projects/Efemera-Egg-01-Research-Canon-v0.1.md
- docs/projects/Efemera-Egg-02-Core-Prototype-v0.1.md
