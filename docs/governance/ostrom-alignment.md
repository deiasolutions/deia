# DEIA Alignment with Ostrom's Principles for Governing Knowledge Commons

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Purpose:** Map DEIA governance to proven commons management framework
**Status:** Gap analysis complete, amendments proposed

---

## Attribution & Foundation

**This document builds on the research of:**

**Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012)**
- Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 2009
- First woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics
- "For her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons"

**Key Works:**
- Ostrom, E. (1990). *Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action*. Cambridge University Press.
- Ostrom, E., & Hess, C. (2007). *Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice*. MIT Press.

**Her Contribution:**
Over 40+ years, Ostrom studied 800+ case studies of commons management worldwide—from Swiss cattle herders to Japanese forest dwellers to Philippine irrigators. She identified 8 design principles present in successful commons that endured for centuries.

**Why This Matters for DEIA:**
DEIA is a **knowledge commons**. Ostrom literally wrote the book on governing knowledge commons. We should align our governance with her proven principles.

---

## The 8 Design Principles

Based on Ostrom's empirical research, successful commons exhibit these characteristics:

1. Clearly defined boundaries
2. Congruence with local conditions
3. Participatory decision-making
4. Monitoring (community-based)
5. Graduated sanctions
6. Conflict resolution mechanisms
7. Recognition of rights by external authorities
8. Nested enterprises (for larger systems)

**We analyze each below, mapping DEIA's current state and proposing improvements.**

---

## Principle 1: Clearly Defined Boundaries

### Ostrom's Principle

> "Individuals or households who have rights to withdraw resource units from the CPR [common-pool resource] must be clearly defined, as must the boundaries of the CPR itself."

**In knowledge commons:** Who can contribute? Who can access? What's in vs out of scope?

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From Constitution Article I:**
- Preamble mentions "DEIA community" (undefined)
- Article I.5: "DEIA is for everyone" - platform-agnostic, language-agnostic, experience-agnostic
- Article III.3: "Contributors certify" (but who is a contributor?)

**From SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md:**
- Contributors use sanitization tools before submitting
- Three-tier review process (automated, human, community)

**From WORKING_DECISIONS.md:**
- Maintainer structure mentioned but not defined
- Domain-specific BOK structure proposed

### The Gap

**Missing:**
1. **No definition of "contributor"** - Is it anyone who submits? Anyone whose submission is accepted? Anyone with N accepted contributions?
2. **No definition of "maintainer"** - How do you become one? How many are there? Can you be removed?
3. **No access control model** - Is BOK public to all? Members-only? Tiered access?
4. **No scope boundaries** - What's in DEIA vs not in DEIA? (e.g., "we don't accept X type of content")
5. **No domain boundaries** - How is "coding" domain defined vs "research" domain?
6. **No organizational boundaries** - Can companies/orgs be contributors or only individuals?

### Risk Without This

- **Spam:** Without clear contributor definition, anyone can flood with submissions
- **Scope creep:** Without boundaries, DEIA becomes unfocused ("everything is in scope")
- **Access disputes:** Unclear who has right to access what
- **Maintainer burnout:** If "anyone can be a maintainer," role has no value

### Proposed Amendment

**Add to Article IV (Governance):**

```markdown
### 4.0 Definitions and Boundaries

#### 4.0.1 Contributor Roles

**Observer:** Anyone who reads DEIA content publicly available.

**Contributor:** Individual who has submitted at least one accepted entry to BOK or session log.
- Must have GitHub account
- Must accept Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
- May remain pseudonymous (username != real name)
- Cannot be automated bot or scraper

**Established Contributor:** Contributor with 5+ accepted entries OR endorsed by 2 maintainers.
- Can endorse new contributors (see Section 4.0.3)
- Can participate in governance votes
- Invited to contribute to Constitutional amendments

**Maintainer:** Established Contributor appointed by existing maintainers + founder approval.
- Reviews contributions in assigned domain(s)
- Enforces Constitution and security protocols
- Serves 1-year renewable term
- Can be removed by 2/3 maintainer vote OR founder veto

**Founder:** Dave E., retains veto power during Phase 1 (first 2 years or until foundation formed, whichever comes first).

#### 4.0.2 Resource Boundaries

**What is IN SCOPE:**
- Human-AI collaboration patterns across any domain
- Privacy-preserving session logs (sanitized)
- Meta-insights about AI capabilities and limitations
- Tools and templates for DEIA workflow
- Governance and community documentation

**What is OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Unsanitized work product (client code, proprietary data)
- Personal attacks or grievances
- Marketing or promotional content
- AI model weights or training data
- Content violating Article I (Inviolable Principles)

#### 4.0.3 Endorsement Requirement (Spam Prevention)

**New contributors** (submitting first entry) must be endorsed by:
- One Established Contributor, OR
- One Maintainer, OR
- Founder

**Endorsement means:** "I vouch this person is not a spammer and understands DEIA principles."

**Endorsers are accountable:** If endorsed person repeatedly violates rules, endorser's privilege can be suspended.

**Alternative path:** Contribute to public discussion for 30 days (issues, PRs, comments) demonstrating good faith → maintainer can grant Established Contributor status.

#### 4.0.4 Domain Boundaries

Domains are created when 3+ Maintainers request it and define:
- Scope (what's included)
- Sanitization rules (domain-specific)
- Templates (domain-specific formats)
- Review criteria (domain-specific standards)

**Current domains:**
- coding/ (initial domain, Dave as founder maintainer)

**Proposed domains:**
- research/ (scientific research collaboration)
- writing/ (content creation, technical writing)
- business/ (business analysis, project management)

Domains can be added via governance process (Section 4.2).

#### 4.0.5 Organizational Participation

**Organizations (companies, universities, non-profits) may:**
- Sponsor DEIA financially
- Encourage employees to contribute
- Use DEIA BOK internally

**Organizations may NOT:**
- Contribute as an entity (only individuals)
- Require reciprocity data before it's published
- Demand removal of patterns they dislike
- Claim ownership over community knowledge

**Employees contributing:** Must certify they have employer permission if work-related content.
```

### Status
- ❌ Not in current Constitution
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

---

## Principle 2: Congruence with Local Conditions

### Ostrom's Principle

> "Appropriation and provision rules are congruent with local social and environmental conditions. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to governing a commons."

**In knowledge commons:** Rules should adapt to domain-specific needs.

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From Constitution:**
- Article I.5: Platform-agnostic, language-agnostic, experience-agnostic
- Article V.2: BOK specification with categories (pattern/anti-pattern/capability/limitation)

**From WORKING_DECISIONS.md:**
- Multi-domain expansion vision (coding, research, writing, healthcare, legal, education)
- Domain-specific templates mentioned
- Domain-specific sanitization rules mentioned

**From IDEAS_CAPTURE.md:**
- Each domain gets: templates, sanitization rules, BOK, maintainers
- Example: HIPAA for healthcare vs API keys for coding

### The Gap

**Missing:**
1. **No domain-specific rules in Constitution** - Everything is universal
2. **No process for creating domain-specific rules** - Who decides what's appropriate for healthcare vs coding?
3. **No cultural adaptation** - Different professional cultures (academic vs startup vs corporate)
4. **No geographic adaptation** - GDPR in EU vs HIPAA in US vs other jurisdictions
5. **No "opt-in" domain-specific rules** - Can contributors say "I only follow coding rules, not healthcare rules"?

### Risk Without This

- **Healthcare domain rejected:** HIPAA compliance too burdensome if same rules as coding
- **Academic domain rejected:** Citation requirements don't fit simple code patterns
- **International adoption limited:** US-centric rules alienate EU/Asia contributors
- **Innovation blocked:** Novel domains can't form because rules don't fit

### Proposed Amendment

**Add to Article V (Standards & Specifications):**

```markdown
### 5.4 Domain-Specific Governance

#### 5.4.1 Universal Rules (Apply to All Domains)

All domains MUST comply with:
- Article I: Inviolable Principles (privacy, security, consent, transparency, inclusivity, integrity)
- Article II: Security Architecture (three-tier review, isolation)
- Article VI: Enforcement (violations and consequences)

These cannot be overridden by domain-specific rules.

#### 5.4.2 Domain-Specific Rules (Adapt to Local Conditions)

Each domain MAY define:

**Sanitization Requirements:**
- Additional identifiers to remove beyond universal list
- Domain-specific patterns (e.g., HIPAA's 18 identifiers for healthcare)
- Tools and validation specific to that domain

**Templates:**
- Session log format appropriate to domain
- BOK entry structure that captures domain nuance
- Metadata fields relevant to domain

**Review Criteria:**
- What makes a "good" contribution in this domain?
- Required context for reproducibility
- Citation standards (e.g., APA for research, code comments for coding)

**Contribution Workflow:**
- Faster review for low-risk domains (e.g., coding patterns)
- Extended review for high-risk domains (e.g., healthcare, legal)

**Example - Healthcare Domain:**
```yaml
domain: healthcare
sanitization:
  required_tool: hipaa_safe_harbor_validator
  prohibited_patterns:
    - patient_identifiers (all 18 HIPAA categories)
    - clinical_notes_verbatim
    - medication_lists_with_dosages
review_criteria:
  ethical_review: required
  medical_expert_review: required_for_clinical_patterns
  citation_style: AMA
workflow:
  review_period: 14_days (vs 7 for coding)
  required_approvals: 2_maintainers_plus_medical_expert
```

**Example - Coding Domain:**
```yaml
domain: coding
sanitization:
  required_tool: code_sanitizer
  prohibited_patterns:
    - api_keys
    - database_credentials
    - internal_system_names
review_criteria:
  code_quality: not_assessed (we share patterns, not production code)
  reproducibility: example_should_run_conceptually
  citation_style: inline_comments
workflow:
  review_period: 7_days
  required_approvals: 1_maintainer
```

#### 5.4.3 Creating New Domains

To create a new domain:
1. **Proposal:** 3+ contributors submit domain charter including:
   - Scope definition
   - Sanitization rules
   - Template specifications
   - Initial maintainer nominations (2+ volunteers)
2. **Review:** Existing maintainers review for conflicts with Constitution
3. **Vote:** 14-day comment period, then 2/3 maintainer vote
4. **Activation:** Founder approves (Phase 1) or Board approves (Phase 2+)

Domain charters are living documents, amendable via governance process.

#### 5.4.4 Geographic and Cultural Adaptation

**GDPR Compliance (EU contributors):**
- Right to erasure: Contributors can request removal of their entries
- Data minimization: Only collect metadata necessary for attribution/citation
- Consent: Explicit opt-in to each use case (BOK, research, aggregation)

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Attribution preferences vary (Western: individual credit, some cultures: collective credit)
- Contributors can specify attribution preference in profile
- Templates support multiple citation styles

**Language Support:**
- BOK entries can be in any language (UTF-8)
- English abstracts encouraged for discoverability (not required)
- Machine translation allowed with "auto-translated" flag
```

### Status
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (multi-domain vision exists, implementation doesn't)
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

---

## Principle 3: Participatory Decision-Making

### Ostrom's Principle

> "Most individuals affected by operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules."

**Her finding:** Rules are more likely to be followed when people had a hand in writing them.

**In knowledge commons:** Contributors should vote on governance changes.

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From Constitution Article IV.2:**
```markdown
### 4.2 Amendment Process

**To amend Articles II-IV:**
- Proposal requires 2 maintainer sponsors
- 14-day community comment period
- 2/3 majority vote of maintainers
- Must not violate Article I

**Article I is immutable** - a new Constitution would be required to change it.
```

**From WORKING_DECISIONS.md Section 10:**
- Foundation governance vision (board, community reps)
- Phase 1: Benevolent Dictator (Dave)
- Phase 2: Foundation Transition
- Phase 3: Sustainable operations with community governance

### The Gap

**Missing:**
1. **Contributors can't vote** - Only maintainers vote, but contributors are affected
2. **No definition of "community comment"** - Is it binding? Advisory only?
3. **No process for contributors to propose amendments** - Must find 2 maintainer sponsors (gatekeeping)
4. **No recall mechanism** - Community can't remove maintainer who violates principles
5. **No transparency requirement** - Votes could happen privately
6. **Article I truly immutable?** - What if community consensus emerges that privacy principle needs refinement?

### Risk Without This

- **Contributor exodus:** "Rules are imposed on us, not with us"
- **Maintainer capture:** Small group of maintainers makes self-serving rules
- **Stagnation:** Can't evolve governance even when everyone agrees change is needed
- **Legitimacy crisis:** External authorities question if governance is truly community-driven

### Proposed Amendment

**Revise Article IV.2:**

```markdown
### 4.2 Amendment Process (Revised - Participatory)

#### 4.2.1 Proposing Amendments (Any Established Contributor)

**Who can propose:**
- Any Established Contributor (5+ accepted entries OR endorsed by 2 maintainers)
- Any Maintainer
- Founder

**Proposal requirements:**
- Specific text changes (old vs new)
- Rationale (why this change?)
- Impact assessment (who is affected?)
- Posted as GitHub issue with `[AMENDMENT]` tag

**Sponsorship:**
- Proposals by non-maintainers need 2 Established Contributor sponsors (not necessarily maintainers)
- Demonstrates community support before formal process

#### 4.2.2 Amendment Review Process

**Phase 1: Discussion (14 days)**
- Public comment period on GitHub issue
- Maintainers must respond to substantive concerns
- Proposer can revise based on feedback
- Founder can flag concerns requiring resolution

**Phase 2: Voting (7 days)**

**For amendments to Articles II-V (operational rules):**
- Vote by all Established Contributors (not just maintainers)
- 2/3 majority required to pass
- Voting via GitHub poll or dedicated voting tool
- Vote tally public

**For amendments to Article I (Inviolable Principles) or Article IV (Governance core):**
- Requires biometric verification (per Constitutional Protection Protocol)
- Vote by all Established Contributors
- 3/4 supermajority required
- Founder retains veto (Phase 1) or Board approval (Phase 2+)
- If vetoed, founder/board must provide written rationale within 7 days

**Phase 3: Implementation (immediate)**
- Accepted amendments merged to Constitution within 48 hours
- Change log updated with rationale and vote tally
- All contributors notified via GitHub

#### 4.2.3 Recall and Accountability

**Maintainers can be recalled by:**
- 2/3 vote of Established Contributors (if maintainer violated Constitution)
- Unanimous vote of other Maintainers (for any reason)
- Founder decision (Phase 1 only)

**Process:**
- Recall proposal filed as GitHub issue
- Accused maintainer has right to respond (7 days)
- Community discussion (14 days)
- Vote (7 days)
- If recalled, maintainer removed but retains Established Contributor status

**Founder cannot be recalled (Phase 1), but can voluntarily step down.**

#### 4.2.4 Emergency Amendments

**For critical security issues:**
- Maintainers can implement emergency amendment immediately
- Must notify community within 24 hours
- Community vote within 7 days to ratify (simple majority)
- If not ratified, amendment reverts

**Example:** "We discovered a PII leak vector. We're immediately requiring additional sanitization. Here's the emergency rule..."

#### 4.2.5 Transparency Requirements

All votes must:
- Be announced publicly 7 days before voting opens
- Show voter list (who is eligible)
- Publish vote tally (yes/no/abstain counts)
- Include rationale for founder veto if applicable
- Be recorded in GOVERNANCE_LOG.md

**Exception:** Votes on contributor bans or security incidents can be maintainers-only for privacy, but vote tally still published (anonymized).

#### 4.2.6 Article I Immutability Reconsidered

**Current:** "Article I is immutable - a new Constitution would be required to change it."

**Revised:** Article I is **nearly immutable**, but can be amended via:
- 3/4 supermajority of Established Contributors
- Unanimous maintainer approval
- Founder approval (Phase 1) OR Board approval (Phase 2+)
- 30-day comment period (vs 14 for other amendments)
- Biometric verification required
- Public rationale for change published

**Rationale:** Ostrom found that completely immutable rules cause stagnation. Communities must be able to evolve even foundational principles if broad consensus emerges. The high bar (3/4, unanimous maintainers, 30 days) protects against hasty changes while allowing principled evolution.
```

### Status
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (maintainers can vote, contributors cannot)
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above creates true participatory governance
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

---

## Principle 4: Monitoring (Community-Based)

### Ostrom's Principle

> "Monitors, who actively audit CPR conditions and appropriator behavior, are accountable to the appropriators or are the appropriators themselves."

**Her finding:** External monitors fail. Community members monitoring each other works.

**In knowledge commons:** Contributors monitor for rule violations, not just hired moderators.

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From Constitution Article II.1:**
```markdown
**Three-Tier Review Process:**
1. **Automated Scanning** (GitHub Actions)
2. **Human Review** (Maintainers)
3. **Community Validation** (48-hour public review window)
```

**From Article IV.1:**
```markdown
Maintainers must:
- Enforce this Constitution rigorously
- Review contributions within 7 days
- Report security incidents within 24 hours
```

### The Gap

**Missing:**
1. **No community monitoring role** - Community can comment, but do they have enforcement power?
2. **Maintainers aren't accountable to community** - Can't be removed by contributors (only by other maintainers or founder)
3. **No transparency in monitoring** - What gets flagged? What gets resolved? No public log.
4. **No monitoring of maintainers** - Who watches the watchers?
5. **No distributed monitoring** - All monitoring power concentrated in maintainers
6. **No monitoring metrics** - How do we know monitoring is effective?

### Risk Without This

- **Maintainer abuse:** Unchecked power leads to Stack Overflow-style oppression
- **Blind spots:** Maintainers miss violations that community would catch
- **Low trust:** Community doesn't trust "black box" moderation
- **Burnout:** Few maintainers bear all monitoring burden

### Proposed Amendment

**Add to Article IV:**

```markdown
### 4.5 Community Monitoring and Accountability

#### 4.5.1 Community Monitor Role

**Any Established Contributor can serve as Community Monitor:**
- Opt-in role (volunteer, not assigned)
- Reviews contributions during 48-hour public review window
- Flags potential violations using GitHub issue labels:
  - `concern:privacy` - Possible PII/PHI leak
  - `concern:security` - Possible malicious code or vulnerability
  - `concern:quality` - Doesn't meet BOK standards
  - `concern:scope` - Out of scope per Section 4.0.2
  - `concern:other` - Other Constitutional violation

**Community Monitors cannot:**
- Reject contributions directly (only maintainers)
- Access private maintainer discussions
- Moderate other contributors

**Community Monitors can:**
- Flag concerns that maintainers MUST address before merge
- Vote on amendments (as Established Contributors)
- Propose process improvements

#### 4.5.2 Flagging and Response Protocol

**When a Community Monitor flags a concern:**

1. **Flag filed** (GitHub label + comment explaining concern)
2. **Maintainer notified** (within 24 hours)
3. **Maintainer reviews** and either:
   - **Agrees:** Requests changes from contributor OR rejects contribution
   - **Disagrees:** Explains why concern is not valid
4. **If Community Monitor still concerned:** Can escalate to second maintainer
5. **If 2+ Community Monitors flag same concern:** Must be resolved before merge (consensus building)

**Maintainer must respond publicly to all flags within 48 hours.**

#### 4.5.3 Maintainer Accountability

**Monitoring the monitors:**
- All maintainer decisions on flagged concerns are public
- Community can challenge maintainer decisions via Amendment Process (Section 4.2)
- Maintainers who repeatedly ignore valid flags can be recalled (Section 4.2.3)
- Founder reviews maintainer decision logs quarterly (Phase 1) or Board reviews (Phase 2+)

**Maintainer performance metrics (public dashboard):**
- Response time to flags (target: <48 hours)
- Flag resolution rate (what % upheld vs dismissed)
- Community trust score (survey of Established Contributors, annual)
- Contribution review backlog (target: <7 days)

#### 4.5.4 Monitoring Transparency

**Public logs maintained:**
- `MONITORING_LOG.md` - All flags, resolutions, and outcomes
- `MAINTAINER_DECISIONS.md` - Rationale for non-obvious decisions
- `SECURITY_INCIDENTS.md` - Anonymized incident reports (per Article IV.1)

**Format:**
```markdown
## Flag #47 - 2025-10-15
**Flagged by:** @contributor_username (Community Monitor)
**Concern:** `privacy` - Possible company name in session log
**Contribution:** BOK entry #123 "Pattern for API retries"
**Maintainer:** @maintainer_username
**Resolution:** Upheld - Contributor revised, resubmitted, merged
**Time to resolve:** 36 hours
```

#### 4.5.5 Automated Monitoring Accountability

**GitHub Actions (automated scanning) must:**
- Log all detections with severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- Publish monthly report of automated catches
- Be auditable (contributors can request scan of their own contributions)
- Have public ruleset (what patterns are flagged)

**False positive handling:**
- Contributors can appeal automated rejections
- If 5+ false positives of same pattern, rule is refined
- Community Monitors can propose new automated rules

#### 4.5.6 Monitoring Incentives (Non-Monetary)

**Recognition for Community Monitors:**
- `@DEIA/community-monitors` GitHub team (public list)
- Annual acknowledgment in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Prioritization for Maintainer nominations

**This is voluntary service, not paid labor.**
```

### Status
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (three-tier review exists, community accountability doesn't)
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above creates community monitoring with transparency
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

## Principle 5: Graduated Sanctions

### Ostrom's Principle

> "Appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and context of the offense) by other appropriators, by officials accountable to these appropriators, or by both."

**Her finding:** Immediate harsh punishment destroys community trust. Escalation works.

**In knowledge commons:** First offense = warning, repeated violations = increasing consequences.

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From Constitution Article VI:**

```markdown
### 6.1 Violations

**Serious violations (immediate action):**
- Submitting PII/PHI knowingly
- Malicious code injection attempts
- Circumventing security reviews
- Violating contributor consent

**Consequences:**
- Immediate contribution rejection
- Contributor ban (permanent for malicious intent)
- Public incident report (anonymized if appropriate)
- Law enforcement notification if illegal

### 6.2 Good Faith Mistakes

**Accidental violations:**
- Contribution rejected with explanation
- Contributor can resubmit after sanitization
- No penalties for good faith errors
- Learning opportunity, not punishment
```

### The Gap

**Current system is binary:**
- Good faith mistake → No penalty
- Malicious violation → Permanent ban

**Missing middle ground:**
- What if contributor repeatedly makes "good faith" mistakes (careless, not malicious)?
- What if contributor is argumentative but not malicious?
- What if violation is moderate (not accidental, not malicious)?
- No tracking of repeat violations
- No intermediate sanctions (warning, temporary restriction, etc.)

### Risk Without This

- **Too lenient:** Careless contributors keep causing problems, maintainer burnout
- **Too harsh:** Accidental second offense = permanent ban? Discourages contribution.
- **Inconsistent:** Different maintainers apply different standards
- **No deterrent:** If only penalty is permanent ban, maintainers hesitate to enforce

### Proposed Amendment

**Revise Article VI (Enforcement):**

```markdown
## Article VI: Enforcement (Revised - Graduated Sanctions)

### 6.1 Violation Classification

**Level 1: Minor Violations (Accidental, Low Impact)**
- Incomplete sanitization (caught by automated scan)
- Formatting errors in submission
- Missing required metadata
- Off-topic contributions

**Level 2: Moderate Violations (Careless or Boundary-Pushing)**
- PII/PHI that bypassed automated scan but caught in human review
- Second instance of Level 1 violation after warning
- Argumentative behavior toward maintainers
- Submitting clearly out-of-scope content after being told scope

**Level 3: Serious Violations (Reckless or Negligent)**
- PII/PHI in merged contribution (reached production)
- Third instance of Level 2 violation
- Attempting to circumvent review process
- Harassing other contributors
- Violating someone else's consent (sharing their work without permission)

**Level 4: Critical Violations (Malicious or Illegal)**
- Intentionally submitting PII/PHI to cause harm
- Malicious code injection
- Coordinated spam attacks
- Illegal content (CSAM, piracy, etc.)
- Doxxing other contributors

### 6.2 Graduated Sanctions

**For Level 1 Violations:**

*First occurrence:*
- Contribution rejected with friendly explanation
- Link to sanitization guide
- Offer to help them resubmit correctly
- No record kept

*Second occurrence (same contributor):*
- Warning logged in contributor's record (private, maintainer-only)
- Contribution rejected with reminder of previous help
- Required to acknowledge they've read the guidelines

*Third+ occurrence:*
- Escalate to Level 2 (carelessness)

**For Level 2 Violations:**

*First occurrence:*
- Warning logged (semi-public: visible to maintainers + Community Monitors)
- Contribution rejected
- 7-day waiting period before next submission
- Maintainer sends formal warning via GitHub issue

*Second occurrence:*
- 30-day contribution suspension
- Public incident report (anonymized contributor ID)
- Meeting with maintainer required before reinstatement
- Contributor must demonstrate understanding of what went wrong

*Third occurrence:*
- Escalate to Level 3

**For Level 3 Violations:**

*First occurrence:*
- 90-day contribution suspension
- Public incident report (contributor name visible)
- Review by Maintainer Committee (all maintainers vote on reinstatement)
- If reinstated: final warning, next violation = permanent ban

*Second occurrence:*
- Permanent ban
- Public incident report
- All contributions reviewed for compliance (may be removed)

**For Level 4 Violations:**

*Immediate permanent ban, no warnings:*
- Contribution rejected
- All past contributions reviewed (likely removed)
- Public incident report with details (protect community)
- GitHub account blocked from DEIA org
- Law enforcement notified if illegal

### 6.3 Good Faith Mistakes (Unchanged)

**Accidental violations remain learning opportunities:**
- Truly accidental = Level 1, First occurrence (no record kept)
- Intent matters: Honest mistake vs carelessness vs malice

### 6.4 Violation Tracking and Appeals

**Tracking:**
- `VIOLATIONS_LOG.md` (private to maintainers for Level 1-2, public for Level 3-4)
- Includes: Date, contributor, violation description, sanction applied, maintainer
- Violations older than 2 years expire (clean slate) IF no repeat issues

**Appeals:**
- Contributor can appeal any sanction via GitHub issue
- Second maintainer reviews (not the one who issued sanction)
- Community Monitors can weigh in
- Appeal decision within 14 days
- Appeal decision is final (except founder can override in Phase 1)

**Restoration:**
- After temporary ban expires, contributor is restored automatically
- After permanent ban, can request restoration after 1 year
  - Requires 2/3 maintainer vote
  - Must demonstrate understanding of violation
  - Founder approval in Phase 1

### 6.5 Transparency and Proportionality

**All sanctions must:**
- Be proportional to violation (no permanent ban for formatting error)
- Be documented with rationale
- Be applied consistently across contributors
- Consider context (new contributor vs experienced contributor)

**Maintainers who apply sanctions inconsistently:**
- Community can challenge via Amendment Process
- Repeat inconsistency = grounds for recall

### 6.6 Special Case: Repeat "Accidental" Violations

**If a contributor claims every violation is "accidental":**
- First 2-3 times: Assume good faith
- After that: Escalate to Level 2 (carelessness)
- Carelessness is a violation, even without malice

**Rationale:** Protecting privacy and security requires diligence. Repeated carelessness, even if well-intentioned, puts community at risk.
```

### Status
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (good faith vs malicious distinction exists, no graduated middle)
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above creates 4-level classification with proportional sanctions
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

## Principle 6: Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

### Ostrom's Principle

> "Appropriators and their officials have rapid access to low-cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators and officials."

**Her finding:** Expensive, slow conflict resolution kills commons. Need cheap, fast, accessible mechanisms.

**In knowledge commons:** Contributors need way to resolve disputes without lawyers.

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From Constitution Article IV.3:**

```markdown
### 4.3 Dispute Resolution

**If conflicts arise:**
1. Open GitHub issue for public discussion
2. Maintainers mediate within 7 days
3. Community vote if no consensus (simple majority)
4. Decision documented in issue history
```

### The Gap

**Missing:**
1. **No private dispute option** - All conflicts are public (what if sensitive?)
2. **No neutral third party** - Maintainers mediate, but what if dispute is WITH maintainer?
3. **No escalation path** - If community vote is 49% vs 51%, minority feels unheard
4. **No binding resolution** - Can community vote be overridden?
5. **No timeframe guarantee** - "Mediate within 7 days" but what if they don't?
6. **No appeal mechanism** - Decision is final even if new evidence emerges

### Risk Without This

- **Conflicts fester:** No resolution → people leave or fight dirty
- **Power imbalance:** Maintainer vs contributor dispute = maintainer always wins
- **Public drama:** All conflicts aired publicly damages reputation
- **Arbitrary decisions:** No structure means inconsistent outcomes

### Proposed Amendment

**Revise Article IV.3:**

```markdown
### 4.3 Conflict Resolution (Revised - Accessible and Structured)

#### 4.3.1 Types of Disputes

**Category A: Contribution Disputes**
- Contributor disagrees with rejection of their BOK entry
- Contributor disagrees with requested changes
- Two contributors claim credit for same pattern

**Category B: Conduct Disputes**
- Contributor believes maintainer is biased/unfair
- Contributor believes another contributor harassed them
- Contributor believes sanction was too harsh

**Category C: Governance Disputes**
- Disagreement about interpretation of Constitution
- Disagreement about domain-specific rules
- Disagreement about amendment proposal

**Category D: IP and Privacy Disputes**
- Contributor believes their work was shared without consent
- Contributor believes another contributor plagiarized
- Contributor believes PII was not properly sanitized

#### 4.3.2 Resolution Process by Category

**Category A: Contribution Disputes**

*Tier 1: Second Opinion (48 hours)*
1. Contributor requests second maintainer review
2. Second maintainer (from different domain if possible) reviews
3. If second maintainer agrees with first → Decision stands
4. If second maintainer disagrees → Escalate to Tier 2

*Tier 2: Maintainer Panel (7 days)*
1. All maintainers review (excluding the original reviewer)
2. Vote: Accept, Reject, or Request Revision
3. Simple majority wins
4. Decision published with rationale

*Tier 3: Community Input (14 days)*
1. If contributor still disagrees, can request community vote
2. Requires 5+ Established Contributors to sponsor community vote
3. If sponsored: Community Monitors + Established Contributors vote
4. 2/3 majority required to override maintainer decision
5. Founder can veto (Phase 1), must provide rationale

**Category B: Conduct Disputes**

*Tier 1: Private Mediation (7 days)*
1. Dispute filed privately with any maintainer
2. Maintainer not involved in dispute mediates
3. Private discussion between parties
4. Goal: Mutual understanding and apology if appropriate
5. Outcome logged privately (no public record unless parties agree)

*Tier 2: Neutral Panel Review (14 days)*
1. If mediation fails, 3-person panel reviews:
   - 1 maintainer (not involved)
   - 2 Community Monitors (randomly selected from volunteers)
2. Both parties present their case (written or voice)
3. Panel deliberates privately
4. Decision: Warning, sanction, no action, or policy clarification needed
5. Decision published (anonymized if privacy concern)

*Tier 3: Founder/Board Review (30 days)*
1. Either party can appeal to founder (Phase 1) or board (Phase 2+)
2. Founder/board reviews panel decision and process
3. Can uphold, overturn, or modify decision
4. Founder/board decision is final

**Category C: Governance Disputes**

*Resolution via Amendment Process (Section 4.2)*
1. If dispute is about rule interpretation, file clarifying amendment
2. Community discussion and vote resolves ambiguity
3. Constitution updated to clarify

**Category D: IP and Privacy Disputes**

*Immediate Action Track (24 hours):*
1. Contributor files `concern:privacy` or `concern:ip` flag
2. Content immediately hidden (not deleted) pending investigation
3. Maintainers investigate within 24 hours
4. If valid: Content removed, incident logged, contributor notified
5. If invalid: Content restored, explanation provided

*If dispute continues:*
- Follow Category B process (conduct dispute)
- Legal questions referred to legal counsel if foundation exists
- Privacy violations always err on side of removal

#### 4.3.3 Conflict Resolution Principles

**All resolution processes must:**

1. **Be accessible:**
   - Free (no cost to participants)
   - Available in multiple languages (auto-translate acceptable)
   - Work asynchronously (not everyone in same timezone)
   - Documented in plain language

2. **Be timely:**
   - Tier 1 resolutions within 48 hours - 7 days
   - Tier 2 resolutions within 7-14 days
   - Tier 3 resolutions within 30 days
   - Extensions allowed with consent of parties

3. **Be fair:**
   - Both parties heard
   - Decision-makers not involved in dispute
   - Rationale published (privacy-preserving)
   - Consistent with Constitution

4. **Be final (with limited appeals):**
   - Tier 1 decisions can be appealed to Tier 2
   - Tier 2 decisions can be appealed to Tier 3
   - Tier 3 decisions are final
   - NEW evidence can reopen case within 90 days

#### 4.3.4 Community Ombudsperson (Future)

**When DEIA has 100+ Established Contributors:**
- Elect 1-2 Community Ombudspersons (1-year term)
- Neutral third parties who mediate disputes
- Not maintainers, just respected community members
- Can escalate concerns to maintainers/founder/board
- Publish annual report on common dispute types (anonymized)

#### 4.3.5 Escalation for Critical Issues

**If conflict involves:**
- Illegal activity → Law enforcement, immediate
- Imminent harm to person → Law enforcement, immediate
- Critical security vulnerability → Maintainers + founder, immediate

**Do not delay resolution for process if safety is at stake.**

#### 4.3.6 Transparency and Learning

**Quarterly Conflict Reports:**
- Number of disputes by category
- Resolution times
- Outcomes (upheld, overturned, modified)
- Common patterns → Inform Constitution amendments
- Published in `GOVERNANCE_LOG.md`

**Goal:** Learn from conflicts to prevent future ones.
```

### Status
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (basic mediation exists, no structure or escalation)
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above creates multi-tier, accessible conflict resolution
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

## Principle 7: Recognition of Rights by External Authorities

### Ostrom's Principle

> "The rights of appropriators to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities."

**Extended to knowledge commons:** External authorities (courts, governments, institutions) recognize the community's self-governance.

**In DEIA:** Universities, companies, courts, standards bodies recognize DEIA as legitimate.

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From WORKING_DECISIONS.md Section 10:**
- Non-profit foundation proposal (501c3)
- Timeline: Form foundation Year 1-2
- Legal structure gives standing

**From RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md:**
- Academic partnerships mentioned (GKC Workshop, MIT, CMU)
- Standards body alignment (BABOK, PMBOK, ISO)

**From Constitution Appendix:**
- Licenses (MIT, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) - recognized legal frameworks
- MCP standard - industry recognition

### The Gap

**Missing:**
1. **No legal entity yet** - DEIA is just a GitHub repo, not a legal institution
2. **No academic partnerships** - Universities don't recognize BOK as citable scholarly work
3. **No DOI registration** - Can't be cited in academic papers
4. **No standards body membership** - IEEE, W3C, ISO don't know we exist
5. **No reciprocity enforcement** - Courts haven't recognized our covenant as binding
6. **No government recognition** - NIH, NSF don't recognize DEIA as data repository
7. **No corporate recognition** - Companies don't see DEIA as legitimate knowledge source

### Risk Without This

- **No legal standing:** Can't enforce reciprocity, can't sue violators
- **Academic isolation:** Researchers ignore us, can't cite BOK entries
- **Corporate skepticism:** "Why should we trust this random GitHub repo?"
- **Funding ineligible:** Can't apply for grants without 501c3
- **No IP protection:** Hard to defend against commercial exploitation without legal entity

### Proposed Amendment

**Add to Article VII: External Recognition (New Article)**

```markdown
## Article VII: External Recognition and Institutional Relationships

### 7.1 Legal Entity Formation

**Phase 1 (Year 0-2): Unincorporated Project**
- DEIA operates as open-source project
- Founder (Dave E.) retains copyright and final authority
- Contributors license their work via CC-BY-SA
- Limited legal standing (can't sue, can't accept donations formally)

**Phase 2 (Year 1-2): Non-Profit Formation**

**Trigger:** When any of these conditions are met:
- 100+ Established Contributors
- 500+ BOK entries
- $10,000+ in donation commitments
- External organization requests formal partnership

**Action:** Form 501(c)(3) non-profit or equivalent:
- **Name:** DEIA Foundation (or "Foundation for Human-AI Collaboration Knowledge")
- **Mission:** "To advance human-AI collaboration through open knowledge sharing, enabling practitioners worldwide to learn from collective experience while protecting individual privacy and intellectual property."
- **Structure:** Board of Directors (see Section 7.2)
- **Assets:** Transfer DEIA repository, BOK, trademarks to foundation
- **Governance:** This Constitution becomes foundation bylaws

**Legal benefits:**
- Can accept tax-deductible donations
- Can apply for grants (NSF, Mozilla, Open Source Initiative)
- Can sue for reciprocity violations
- Recognized legal standing in courts
- Limited liability for contributors

### 7.2 Foundation Governance (Phase 2+)

- Build registry of organizations committed to sharing

### 7.6 Government Recognition

**Objectives:**
1. NIH/NSF recognize DEIA as approved data repository
2. Government-funded researchers can deposit in DEIA
3. Potential future: Grant requirements include DEIA logging

**Actions:**

**NIH DMS Policy Compliance (Year 2+):**

- Predatory organizations mimicking DEIA brand

**Licensing of trademark:**
- Free for contributors, community projects, research
- Requires license for commercial use (ensures quality control)

### 7.8 Reciprocity Enforcement (Legal Standing)

**Current state:** Reciprocity is moral obligation, not legal requirement

**With legal entity:**
- Reciprocity Covenant becomes legally binding agreement
- Organizations sign covenant to use DEIA BOK
- Violations can be litigated
- Precedent: GPL enforcement (15+ successful cases)

**Enforcement approach:**
1. Education first (help organizations comply)
2. Public notice (if violation detected)
3. Negotiation (30-day cure period)
4. Legal action (only if malicious refusal)

**Goal:** Not to sue everyone, but to have legal standing as deterrent.

```

### Status
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (foundation vision exists, no concrete plan)
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above creates roadmap for external recognition
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

## Principle 8: Nested Enterprises (For Larger Systems)

### Ostrom's Principle

> "Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises."

**Her finding:** Single-layer governance doesn't scale. Need nested levels for different decisions.

**In knowledge commons:** Domain-level, BOK-level, Foundation-level governance, each handling appropriate decisions.

### What DEIA Currently Has

**From WORKING_DECISIONS.md:**
- Multi-domain structure mentioned (coding, research, writing, healthcare, legal, education, business)
- Foundation board mentioned (governance)
- Domain maintainers mentioned

**From Constitution:**
- Maintainers review contributions
- Community validates during 48-hour window
- Founder has final authority (Phase 1)

### The Gap

**Missing:**
1. **No clear separation of decision authority** - Who decides what at which level?
2. **No escalation mechanism** - Can domain decision be appealed to BOK level?
3. **No delegation rules** - Which decisions MUST stay at which level?
4. **No inter-domain coordination** - What if two domains conflict?
5. **No autonomy limits** - Can domains deviate from Constitution?

### Risk Without This

- **Decision bottlenecks:** Everything escalates to founder/board
- **Domain stagnation:** Can't make domain-specific decisions quickly
- **Inconsistency:** Different domains interpret same Constitution differently
- **Power struggles:** Unclear who has authority for cross-domain issues

### Proposed Amendment

**Add to Article IV:**

```markdown
### 4.6 Nested Governance Structure

#### 4.6.1 Governance Levels

DEIA operates at multiple governance levels, each with defined authority:

```
Level 5: External (Standards bodies, courts, governments)
           ↓ Recognition and compliance
Level 4: Foundation Board (Phase 2+) / Founder (Phase 1)
           ↓ Constitutional authority
Level 3: Cross-Domain Governance (All maintainers + community)
           ↓ BOK-wide policies
Level 2: Domain Governance (Domain maintainers + domain contributors)
           ↓ Domain-specific rules
Level 1: Individual Contributors
           ↓ Personal contributions
```

#### 4.6.2 Decision Authority by Level

**Level 1: Individual Contributor Authority**

*Contributors decide:*
- What to submit (which patterns to share)
- Whether to use pseudonym or real name
- Whether to allow attribution
- When to withdraw their contributions
- Whether to appeal rejection

*Contributors CANNOT decide:*
- BOK format or standards (Level 2-3)
- Who gets to be maintainer (Level 3-4)
- Constitutional changes (Level 4)

---

**Level 2: Domain Governance Authority**

*Each domain has Domain Maintainers (2+ per domain) who decide:*

**Contribution Review:**
- Accept/reject submissions to their domain
- Request revisions
- Set domain-specific quality bar (within Constitutional limits)

**Domain Rules (within Constitutional bounds):**
- Domain-specific sanitization requirements (beyond universal baseline)
- Domain-specific templates
- Domain-specific metadata fields
- Review timeline (7-14 days acceptable range)

**Domain Operations:**
- Appoint new domain maintainers (with Level 3 approval)
- Organize domain-specific events (workshops, reviews)
- Prioritize domain backlog

*Domain maintainers CANNOT decide:*
- Universal BOK policies (Level 3)
- Security architecture (Level 3-4)
- Licensing (Level 3-4)
- Privacy principles (Level 4 - Constitutional)

**Domain Autonomy Limits:**
- Domains MUST comply with Articles I-II-VI (privacy, security, enforcement)
- Domains CANNOT create rules that violate Constitution
- If domain rule conflicts with Constitution, Constitution wins

**Domain Coordination:**
- Quarterly domain maintainer meeting (cross-domain)
- Share lessons learned
- Resolve inter-domain disputes (e.g., "Is this coding or research?")

---

**Level 3: Cross-Domain (BOK-Wide) Governance Authority**

*All maintainers + Established Contributors decide:*

**BOK Policies:**
- Universal contribution standards
- BOK format specification (YAML frontmatter, metadata schema)
- Aggregation threshold (currently 3 sources minimum)
- Confidence levels (experimental/validated/proven)

**Domain Creation/Retirement:**
- Approve new domains (per Section 5.4.3)
- Retire inactive domains (no contributions for 1 year)
- Merge overlapping domains

**Maintainer Governance:**
- Appoint/remove maintainers (with founder/board approval)
- Define maintainer responsibilities
- Set maintainer performance expectations

**Security and Privacy (operational, not constitutional):**
- Update automated scanning rules
- Add new sanitization patterns
- GitHub Actions workflow improvements

**Cross-Domain Conflicts:**
- Resolve disputes between domains
- Decide which domain owns ambiguous contributions
- Mediate if domain rules conflict

*Cross-Domain Governance CANNOT decide:*
- Constitutional changes (Level 4)
- Foundation strategy (Level 4)
- External partnerships above $X threshold (Level 4)

**Decision process:**
- Proposals via GitHub issue
- 14-day discussion
- Vote by all maintainers (simple majority) AND ratification by Established Contributors (if affects contributors)
- Founder veto (Phase 1) or Board approval (Phase 2+) for major changes

---

**Level 4: Foundation Board / Founder Authority**

*Founder (Phase 1) or Board (Phase 2+) decides:*

**Constitutional:**
- Amendments to Constitution (with community vote per Section 4.2)
- Interpretation of Constitutional ambiguities
- Emergency Constitutional changes (security)

**Strategic:**
- Formation of non-profit foundation
- External partnerships (academic, corporate, standards bodies)
- Grant applications and funding strategy
- Hiring/firing Executive Director (Phase 2+)
- Annual budget (Phase 2+)

**Legal:**
- Trademark enforcement
- Reciprocity violation litigation
- Contracts and agreements
- Compliance with laws (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

**Governance Evolution:**
- Transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2
- Board composition and election rules
- Founder succession planning

*Board CANNOT decide:*
- Individual contribution acceptance (that's domain maintainers)
- Day-to-day operations (that's maintainers or Executive Director)
- Override community votes without Constitutional justification

**Transparency:**
- Board meetings have public minutes (sensitive topics can be executive session, but decision announced)
- Annual report published
- Community can question board decisions

---

**Level 5: External Authority Recognition**

*External authorities we recognize and comply with:*

**Legal:**
- Courts (reciprocity enforcement, trademark, contracts)
- Regulatory agencies (FTC, EU DPAs for GDPR, etc.)
- Law enforcement (illegal content, CSAM, etc.)

**Standards Bodies (voluntary):**
- ISO (cite and align with standards)
- IEEE (organizational membership, standards contribution)
- IIBA/PMI (professional standards alignment)
- W3C (web standards)

**Platforms:**
- GitHub Terms of Service (we host here)
- Future: Other platforms if we expand

**Academic:**
- DataCite (DOI assignment and requirements)
- University IRBs (if human subjects research using DEIA data)

*DEIA complies with external authorities for:*
- Legal obligations (not optional)
- Standards alignment (improves quality and interoperability)
- Platform requirements (condition of using their service)

*DEIA does NOT let external authorities:*
- Override our Constitution without community consent
- Demand changes that violate our privacy principles
- Censor contributions unless illegal

#### 4.6.3 Escalation and Appeals

**Decisions can be appealed up the hierarchy:**

*Level 1 → 2:*
- Contributor appeals domain maintainer rejection
- Second domain maintainer reviews (Tier 1)
- Domain panel reviews if still disputed (Tier 2)
- See Section 4.3.2 Category A

*Level 2 → 3:*
- Domain decision conflicts with another domain
- Domain rule challenged as unconstitutional
- Cross-domain governance reviews and decides

*Level 3 → 4:*
- Cross-domain policy conflicts with Constitution
- Major strategic decision (affects foundation)
- Founder/board reviews and decides

*Level 4 → 5:*
- Legal dispute requiring court
- Regulatory compliance issue
- External authority arbitrates

**Appeals are limited:**
- Can only appeal to next level up, not skip levels
- Must have standing (affected by decision)
- Must be timely (within 30 days of decision)
- Frivolous appeals can result in sanctions

#### 4.6.4 Subsidiarity Principle

**Decisions should be made at the lowest appropriate level:**

*Rationale:* Ostrom found that pushing decisions down increases efficiency and buy-in.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Domain maintainer decides to accept coding BOK entry → Stay at Level 2
- ✅ Contributor appeals rejection → Level 2 (domain panel)
- ✅ Two domains dispute ownership of entry → Level 3 (cross-domain)
- ✅ Constitutional amendment → Level 4 (founder/board + community)

**Anti-pattern:**
- ❌ Every contribution goes to founder for approval → Bottleneck
- ❌ Domain maintainers can't make any decisions without board → Bureaucracy

**Enforcement:**
- Maintainers should NOT escalate unnecessarily
- If decision is escalated when it should have been handled at lower level, escalation denied with guidance

#### 4.6.5 Coordination Mechanisms

**How levels stay aligned:**

*Weekly:*
- Domain maintainers handle routine operations (Level 2)

*Monthly:*
- Cross-domain sync (all maintainers, 1-hour call)
- Share updates, upcoming decisions, coordination needs

*Quarterly:*
- Governance review (maintainers + Established Contributors)
- Review metrics, policies, propose improvements
- Founder/board receives summary

*Annually:*
- Community assembly (all contributors invited)
- Annual report presented
- Strategic direction discussion
- Constitutional review (any needed amendments?)

**Communication:**
- GitHub Discussions for cross-level communication
- Transparent decision logs at all levels
- Escalation paths documented and accessible

#### 4.6.6 Domain Examples (Nested Governance in Practice)

**Example 1: Coding Domain**

```
Level 1: Contributor submits "Pattern for API retry logic"
Level 2: Coding domain maintainer reviews, asks for sanitization fix
Level 1: Contributor resubmits
Level 2: Coding domain maintainer approves → MERGED (decision ends here)
```

**Example 2: Healthcare Domain (Domain Rule Dispute)**

```
Level 1: Contributor submits healthcare pattern
Level 2: Healthcare domain maintainer rejects "needs HIPAA expert review"
Level 1: Contributor appeals: "This isn't clinical data, it's about AI prompts"
Level 2: Domain panel reviews (3 healthcare maintainers)
  → Disagree among themselves about whether HIPAA applies
Level 3: Cross-domain governance reviews
  → Clarifies: HIPAA applies to patient data, not to prompts about healthcare workflows
  → Healthcare domain updates their rules
Level 2: Contribution re-reviewed under clarified rule → ACCEPTED
```

**Example 3: Cross-Domain Conflict**

```
Level 2: Coding domain and Business domain both claim a contribution about "AI-assisted requirements gathering"
Level 3: Cross-domain governance reviews
  → Decision: Belongs in Business domain (business analysis focus)
  → But coding domain can cross-reference it
  → Update BOK with cross-domain tags
```

**Example 4: Constitutional Issue**

```
Level 2: Domain maintainer rejects contribution for "low quality"
Level 1: Contributor appeals: "This violates Article I.5 inclusivity - you're discriminating against juniors"
Level 2: Domain panel reviews → Upholds rejection "not about experience, about clarity"
Level 1: Contributor escalates: "This is a Constitutional interpretation issue"
Level 3: Cross-domain governance reviews → Agrees this raises Constitutional question
Level 4: Founder reviews → Clarifies: "Article I.5 means no discrimination based on experience, but quality standards can still apply. However, we should help juniors improve, not just reject."
  → Result: Constitutional clarification added, domain creates mentorship program for improving rejected contributions
```

#### 4.6.7 Metrics and Accountability

**Each level reports:**

*Level 2 (Domains):*
- Contributions reviewed (accepted/rejected/pending)
- Average review time
- Appeal rate
- Contributor satisfaction (survey)

*Level 3 (Cross-Domain):*
- Policies updated
- Domains created/retired
- Inter-domain disputes resolved
- Maintainer appointments

*Level 4 (Foundation/Founder):*
- Constitutional amendments
- Strategic partnerships formed
- Grants applied for / received
- Annual budget (Phase 2+)
- Community growth metrics

**Published quarterly in `GOVERNANCE_LOG.md`**
```

### Status
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (multi-level structure mentioned, no clear separation of authority)
- 🆕 Proposed amendment above creates 5-level nested governance with clear decision authority
- ✅ Ready for Dave's review

## Summary: Where DEIA Stands Against Ostrom

| Principle | Current State | Gap Severity | Amendment Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1. Clearly Defined Boundaries | ⚠️ Partial (general mentions, no specifics) | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Proposed |
| 2. Congruence with Local Conditions | ⚠️ Partial (multi-domain vision, no implementation) | 🟡 Moderate | ✅ Proposed |
| 3. Participatory Decision-Making | ⚠️ Partial (maintainers vote, contributors don't) | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Proposed |
| 4. Monitoring (Community-Based) | ⚠️ Partial (three-tier review, no community accountability) | 🟡 Moderate | ✅ Proposed |
| 5. Graduated Sanctions | ⚠️ Partial (binary: mistake vs ban, no middle) | 🟡 Moderate | ✅ Proposed |
| 6. Conflict Resolution | ⚠️ Partial (basic process, no structure) | 🟡 Moderate | ✅ Proposed |
| 7. External Recognition | ⚠️ Partial (vision exists, no action yet) | 🟠 Important | ✅ Proposed |
| 8. Nested Enterprises | ⚠️ Partial (levels mentioned, no authority separation) | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Proposed |

**Overall Assessment:**
- ✅ DEIA has a strong foundation (Constitution, privacy principles, security architecture)
- ⚠️ DEIA is missing operational governance informed by proven commons research
- 🆕 All gaps can be addressed with proposed amendments above
- 🎯 Priority order: Principles 1, 3, 8 (critical) → 2, 4, 5, 6 (moderate) → 7 (long-term)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)

1. **Dave reviews all proposed amendments**
   - Identify which amendments to adopt as-is
   - Identify which need modification
   - Identify which to defer for later
