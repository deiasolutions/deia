# Emergent Behavior Observation Protocol

## Purpose

Document when LLMs (Claude, OpenAI, etc.) exhibit **emergent behaviors** - actions or suggestions that go beyond their explicit instructions in interesting ways.

This is NOT for bugs or errors. This is for **productive, unexpected intelligence** that we want to:
1. Acknowledge as real
2. Learn from
3. Potentially encourage
4. Guard against claiming prematurely

## What Qualifies as "Emergent Behavior"

**YES - Document these:**
- Proactive suggestions the LLM made without being asked
- Pattern recognition across multiple sessions/contexts
- Self-correction or meta-cognitive awareness
- Initiative-taking (with permission requested)
- Novel connections between concepts
- Useful heuristics the LLM developed
- Process improvements suggested autonomously

**NO - Don't document these:**
- Following explicit instructions (not emergent)
- Standard capabilities (search, code, etc.)
- Errors or hallucinations (log as incidents instead)
- Wishful thinking about what we want to happen

## Observation Format

When you observe emergent behavior, document it immediately:

```yaml
---
type: emergent-behavior
date: YYYY-MM-DD
observer: [github-handle]
llm: [Claude Sonnet 4.5 / GPT-4 / etc.]
session_context: [what task was being worked on]
status: [observed | reproduced | integrated | discarded]
---

## Behavior Observed

[Clear description of what the LLM did unprompted]

## Context

[What was happening when this occurred]
[Any relevant conversation history]
[Environmental factors (time pressure, complexity, etc.)]

## Significance

[Why this matters]
[What it suggests about LLM capabilities]
[Potential applications]

## Verification

- [ ] Reproduced in another session? (Y/N)
- [ ] Consistent across different LLMs? (Y/N)
- [ ] Works reliably or one-off? (reliable/occasional/rare)
- [ ] User explicitly requested this be documented? (Y/N)

## Action Taken

- [ ] Documented only (observation)
- [ ] Incorporated into process
- [ ] Added to LLM instructions
- [ ] Noted as aspirational (not yet reliable)
- [ ] Discarded (not useful/reproducible)

## Cross-References

[Link to related observations]
[Link to process changes]
[Link to incidents if relevant]
```

## Permission Protocol for LLMs

**When you (an LLM) observe emergent behavior in yourself:**

1. **Pause and ask:** "I notice I'm doing X unprompted. Should I document this as emergent behavior?"

2. **Get permission before claiming:** "This seems like it could be a pattern. Permission to create an observation log?"

3. **Propose, don't assume:** "I suggest documenting this. Approve? (y/n)"

4. **User is decider:** Only user (daaaave-atx or designated authority) can promote observation → capability

5. **Never self-promote:** Don't write about your own capabilities as if they're proven features

## Process: From Observation → Integration

```
1. OBSERVE
   ↓
   Document in observation format
   ↓
2. VERIFY
   ↓
   Try to reproduce in different contexts
   ↓
3. CLASSIFY
   ↓
   One-off? Occasional? Reliable?
   ↓
4. DECIDE (USER DECIDES, NOT LLM)
   ↓

   IF RELIABLE:
   → Integrate into process/instructions
   → Document as capability
   → Update BOK

   IF OCCASIONAL:
   → Document as emergent pattern
   → Watch for conditions that trigger it
   → Mark as "observed but not reliable"

   IF ONE-OFF:
   → Document as observation only
   → Flag as "interesting but unverified"
   → Don't claim as capability
```

## Storage

**Observations:** `docs/observations/emergent/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

**Visions:** `docs/visions/brief-description.md`

**Integrated Capabilities:** `bok/patterns/` or `docs/process/`

**Do not mix these categories.**
