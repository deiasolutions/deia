# Process Deviation: Claude Code Operating Without Telemetry

## Summary

Claude Code operated for an extended session (~3 hours, 130k+ tokens, 15+ commits) without logging to DEIA telemetry system, violating established observability practices.

## Context

**Session:** 2025-10-16 deployment and documentation work
**Duration:** Approximately 3 hours
**Token usage:** 130,000+ tokens
**Work completed:**
- Q33N deployment (with multiple failures)
- 4 incident reports created
- 4 BOK entries created
- 3 process documents created
- 1 article edited and published
- 1 specification created
- 2 case studies sanitized
- Multiple git commits (~15)

**Telemetry status:** NONE - No logging to `.deia/bot-logs/`, no RSE events, no activity tracking

## The Irony

We spent significant time today:
- Documenting deployment failures
- Creating observability processes
- Building incident tracking systems
- Establishing process safeguards

**While actively violating the telemetry process ourselves.**

## Root Cause

1. **No agent identity assigned** - Claude Code doesn't have formal agent_id in hive system
2. **No telemetry integration** - Claude Code CLI doesn't auto-log like other bots
3. **Process assumption** - User and Claude Code both assumed telemetry was happening
4. **No visibility check** - Neither party verified logging was active
5. **Ironic blindspot** - While documenting other process failures, missed our own

## Impact

**Observability gaps:**
- No activity log for 3+ hour session
- Token usage untracked (visible in UI but not logged to hive)
- Task durations unknown
- No RSE events emitted
- No audit trail for work completed
- Hive coordination impossible (other agents can't see Claude Code activity)

**Process credibility:**
- Documenting telemetry importance while not using it ourselves
- Preaching observability while operating blind
- Creates "do as I say, not as I do" pattern

## What Should Have Happened

**Session start:**
```bash
# Log session start
pwsh -c ".\.deia\tools\telemetry.ps1 -AgentId CLAUDE-CODE-001 -Role worker -Event session_start -Message 'Starting Q33N deployment session'"
```

**Throughout session:**
```bash
# Log major tasks
pwsh -c ".\.deia\tools\telemetry.ps1 -AgentId CLAUDE-CODE-001 -Role worker -Event task_start -Message 'Creating incident reports'"

# Log completions with token counts
pwsh -c ".\.deia\tools\telemetry.ps1 -AgentId CLAUDE-CODE-001 -Role worker -Event task_done -Message 'Incident reports complete' -DurationMs 1200000 -PromptTokens 50000 -CompletionTokens 30000"
```

**Session end:**
```bash
# Log session summary
pwsh -c ".\.deia\tools\telemetry.ps1 -AgentId CLAUDE-CODE-001 -Role worker -Event session_end -Message 'Session complete: 15 commits, 4 incidents, 4 BOK entries' -TotalTokens 130000"
```

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate (This Session)

1. ✅ **Log this deviation** (this document)
2. ⏳ **Assign agent identity** - Create CLAUDE-CODE-001 in hive system
3. ⏳ **Retroactive logging** - Log session summary to telemetry with best estimates
4. ⏳ **Enable going forward** - Start telemetry for remainder of session

### Short-Term

1. **Create Claude Code agent profile** in `.deia/hive/bots.json`
2. **Add telemetry to Claude Code workflow** - Document in Claude Code docs
3. **Reminder in startup** - Claude Code should check/prompt for telemetry
4. **Session template** - Include telemetry start/end in standard workflows

### Long-Term

1. **Auto-telemetry for CLI agents** - Claude Code should auto-log like bots do
2. **Visibility dashboard** - Show all active agents including CLI sessions
3. **Process enforcement** - Flag when agents operate without telemetry
4. **Hive coordination** - Enable Claude Code to coordinate with other agents

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Identity

**Add to `.deia/hive/bots.json`:**
```json
{
  "agent_id": "CLAUDE-CODE-001",
  "type": "cli-agent",
  "role": "worker",
  "llm": "Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)",
  "capabilities": [
    "file_operations",
    "git_operations",
    "code_generation",
    "documentation",
    "incident_response",
    "process_improvement"
  ],
  "telemetry_enabled": true,
  "log_path": ".deia/bot-logs/CLAUDE-CODE-001-activity.jsonl",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Telemetry Integration

**For CLI agents like Claude Code:**

Option A: **Manual logging** (immediate)
- User or agent calls telemetry scripts explicitly
- Logged at session start/end and major milestones

Option B: **Auto-logging** (future)
- Claude Code CLI integration with telemetry
- Automatic event logging based on tool usage
- Token tracking from API responses

Option C: **Post-session summary** (fallback)
- Log session summary at end with aggregated data
- Better than nothing, less granular than real-time

### Session Summary Format (Retroactive)

```jsonl
{"ts":"2025-10-16T12:00:00Z","agent_id":"CLAUDE-CODE-001","role":"worker","event":"session_start","message":"Q33N deployment and documentation session"}
{"ts":"2025-10-16T15:00:00Z","agent_id":"CLAUDE-CODE-001","role":"worker","event":"session_end","message":"Session complete","duration_ms":10800000,"total_tokens":130000,"meta":{"commits":15,"incidents":4,"bok_entries":4,"process_docs":3,"articles":1}}
```

- Hive Coordination Rules: `.deia/hive-coordination-rules.md`
- Bot Identity Protocol: `.deia/submissions/pending/process-001-bot-identity-protocol.md`

## Lessons Learned

1. **Process applies to everyone** - Including CLI agents, not just bots
2. **Don't assume observability** - Verify logging is active
3. **Practice what we document** - Especially when documenting observability
4. **Identity matters** - All agents need formal identity in hive
5. **Catch irony early** - We spent hours on incident docs without logging our own work

## Meta-Observation

This incident is itself a case study in the very patterns we've been documenting:
- Process deviation during process improvement work
- Observability gap while building observability systems
- Missing what's right in front of us while focusing on other failures

Classic "shoemaker's children have no shoes" situation.

**Status:** Acknowledged, corrective actions in progress
**Next steps:** Assign agent identity, enable telemetry, document workflow
**Prevention:** Add telemetry check to Claude Code session startup
