This document will summarize the training approach, hyperparameters, and key learnings for the Bot C submission. Content will be populated as the session progresses.

## Checklist

- [ ] Describe chosen RL method and rationale
- [ ] Document environment setup and dependencies
- [ ] Summarize training procedure and tuning decisions
- [ ] Present evaluation protocol and results overview
- [ ] Capture future improvements / follow-up ideas

## Session Notes

- Kickoff (08:21 CDT): selected DQN baseline via stable-baselines3, pending dependency verification.
- 00:10 mark: Copied Gymnasium environment locally and implemented accelerated `training/train_dqn.py` with 120k timestep default, session-specific logging, and deterministic evaluation utilities.

Further details will be appended after training and evaluation complete.
