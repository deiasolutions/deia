# DEIA Roadmap

**Honest, phased approach to building knowledge infrastructure**

---

## Where We Are Today

**What actually works:**
- `ConversationLogger` Python class for logging Claude Code sessions
- Manual session capture (call `create_session_log()` with conversation data)
- BOK structure with ~10 community-contributed patterns
- Governance docs (Constitution, Principles, Contributing)

**What exists but isn't validated:**
- `pyproject.toml` packaging setup
- `deia` CLI commands (`init`, `install`, etc.)
- Installer code (`installer.py`)
- Sanitization and validation modules

**What doesn't exist:**
- Automated pattern extraction
- VS Code extension
- PyPI package
- Real-time auto-logging
- Multi-domain expansion

---

## Phase 1: Get the Basics Working (Current)

**Goal:** Make DEIA installable and usable for early adopters

###  Tasks

- [ ] Test `pip install -e .` works
- [ ] Verify `deia init` creates proper `.deia/` structure
- [ ] **Complete conversation logger implementation:**
  - [x] Logger infrastructure (`ConversationLogger` class, file writing) âœ…
  - [ ] Actual conversation capture mechanism (stdin, file, or API)
  - [ ] Real-time logging during sessions (not just manual calls)
  - [ ] Integration with Claude Code or other AI tools
  - [ ] Test end-to-end with real conversation data
- [ ] Document actual installation steps
- [ ] Fix any import/dependency issues
- [ ] Create simple test suite
- [ ] Write honest installation guide

**Success criteria:** A developer can clone, install, and start logging sessions **with real conversations, not hardcoded test data**

---

## Phase 2: Automated Pattern Extraction (Next)

**Goal:** Make it easy to extract patterns from logs without manual work

### Tasks

- [ ] Build pattern extraction CLI (`deia extract <session-file>`)
- [ ] Implement sanitization automation (detect/remove PII, secrets)
- [ ] Create pattern templates for common types
- [ ] Add validation checks before BOK submission
- [ ] Build diff tool to review changes before committing
- [ ] Integrate with git workflow

**Success criteria:** User can run `deia extract` and get a sanitized, ready-to-submit pattern

---

## Phase 3: Claude Code Integration (Q1 2026)

**Goal:** Seamless auto-logging for Claude Code users

### Tasks

- [ ] Finish `.claude/INSTRUCTIONS.md` bootstrap
- [ ] Test slash commands (`/log`, `/auto-log-check`)
- [ ] Fix import issues (sys.path workaround or package install)
- [ ] Auto-detect when Claude Code is running
- [ ] Stream conversations to `.deia/sessions/` in real-time
- [ ] Add session recovery after crashes
- [ ] Create user documentation

**Success criteria:** Claude Code users get auto-logging with zero configuration

---

## Phase 4: VS Code Extension (Q2 2026)

**Goal:** DEIA works with ALL AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, Continue, etc.)

### Tasks

- [ ] Build VS Code extension scaffold
- [ ] Hook into AI assistant conversations (vendor-agnostic)
- [ ] Stream to `.deia/sessions/` in real-time
- [ ] Add UI for session review
- [ ] Implement pattern extraction from UI
- [ ] Publish to VS Code marketplace
- [ ] Support multiple AI vendors simultaneously

**Success criteria:** Works with Claude, GPT, Copilot, Gemini - any VS Code AI extension

---

## Phase 5: PyPI Package (Q3 2026)

**Goal:** `pip install deia` works for everyone

### Tasks

- [ ] Finalize API stability
- [ ] Complete test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Register on PyPI
- [ ] Version management (semantic versioning)
- [ ] Release v1.0.0

**Success criteria:** `pip install deia` installs cleanly on Windows/Mac/Linux

---

## Phase 6: Academic Partnerships (Q4 2026)

**Goal:** DEIA becomes citable research infrastructure

### Tasks

- [ ] Register with Zenodo (DOI assignment)
- [ ] Partner with HCI researchers
- [ ] Create anonymized dataset for research (opt-in)
- [ ] Publish whitepaper on human-AI collaboration patterns
- [ ] Present at academic conferences (CHI, CSCW)
- [ ] Establish ethics review process

**Success criteria:** Researchers can cite DEIA BOK in papers

---

## Phase 7: Multi-Domain Expansion (2027+)

**Goal:** DEIA works beyond coding - research, healthcare, legal, education

### Vision

**Research:** Lab notebooks, experimental logs, literature reviews
**Healthcare:** Clinical decision logs, treatment pattern sharing
**Legal:** Case research, precedent patterns, brief strategies
**Education:** Teaching strategies, student interaction patterns
**Business:** Decision logs, strategy patterns, market insights

### Requirements

- Domain-specific sanitization (HIPAA, attorney-client privilege, etc.)
- Domain expert governance boards
- Specialized pattern taxonomies
- Compliance frameworks
- Academic/professional partnerships

**Timeline:** Proof of concept in one non-coding domain by end of 2027

---

## Long-Term Vision

**10-year goal:** DEIA becomes default infrastructure for human-AI collaboration knowledge

**What success looks like:**
- Millions of developers logging sessions
- 100K+ patterns in BOK across domains
- Standard citation in academic research
- Integration with major AI tools (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google adopt DEIA format)
- Self-sustaining community governance
- Cross-domain pattern learning (coding insights help medical practitioners, etc.)

**Sustainability:**
- Community-funded (donations, sponsorships)
- University partnerships (grant funding)
- Ethical commercial partnerships (no data selling, no ads)
- Maintainer stipends (dignified compensation)

---

## What Could Derail This

**Technical risks:**
- Privacy breach (accidental PII/secret exposure)
- Scalability issues (BOK becomes unwieldy)
- Vendor pushback (AI companies block logging)

**Community risks:**
- Governance failure (becomes toxic like Stack Overflow)
- Low adoption (nobody uses it)
- Contributor burnout

**Legal risks:**
- TOS violations claims
- Copyright disputes
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

**Mitigations:**
- Strong privacy-first architecture
- Ostrom governance (proven at scale)
- Legal review process
- Transparent decision-making
- Community support for maintainers

---

## How to Help

**Right now:**
- Test `pip install -e .` and report issues
- Use `ConversationLogger` in your work
- Contribute patterns to BOK
- Review governance docs and suggest improvements

**Soon:**
- Test automated pattern extraction
- Beta test Claude Code integration
- Help with VS Code extension
- Spread the word

**Long-term:**
- Maintain parts of the codebase
- Join governance board
- Sponsor development
- Expand to new domains
