# FLIGHT-1 Progress Report — BOT-00002

Summary
- Prepared and submitted docs-first Season/Flight terminology transition proposal. Awaiting next orders; pausing edits per instruction.

Work Completed
- Handoff created with audit, before/after excerpts, and unified diff previews: `.deia/handoffs/FLIGHT-1-terminology-transition.md`.
- Quick troubleshooting guide (~200 words) drafted: `.deia/guides/BOT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- Approval request and follow-up sent to 001: 
  - `.deia/hive/responses/2025-10-19-0842-002-001-APPROVAL-flight-1-terminology-apply.md`
  - `.deia/hive/responses/2025-10-19-0848-002-001-FOLLOWUP-flight-terminology-option-A.md`
- Decision recorded: Option A — use “flight status update” in current docs (handoff updated accordingly).

Files Proposed/Edited
- Proposed (no direct edits applied yet):
  - `.deia/AGENTS.md` — “tasks & sprints” → “tasks & flights”.
  - `.deia/coordination/agent-telemetry.md` — Sprint → Flight; “daily status report” → “flight status update”.
  - `.deia/coordination/PHASE-2-STRATEGIC-PRIORITIES.md` — mid-sprint → mid-flight.
  - `.deia/README.md` — add “Seasons & Flights” glossary.
- Created/updated during this flight:
  - `.deia/handoffs/FLIGHT-1-terminology-transition.md`
  - `.deia/guides/BOT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - `.deia/hive/responses/2025-10-19-0830-002-001-SYNC-flight-1-terminology-complete.md`
  - `.deia/hive/responses/2025-10-19-0842-002-001-APPROVAL-flight-1-terminology-apply.md`
  - `.deia/hive/responses/2025-10-19-0848-002-001-FOLLOWUP-flight-terminology-option-A.md`

Decisions
- APPROVED to apply within `.deia/` scope (then superseded by pause instruction).
- Phrase choice: Option A — “flight status update”.

Blockers/Risks
- None technical. Primary risk is lingering terminology inconsistency until edits are applied; mitigated by clear handoff and ready-to-apply diffs.

Suggested Next Steps (pending new orders)
1) Apply the scoped `.deia/` doc edits using Option A phrasing.
2) Draft `.deia/templates/SEASON-CHARTER.md` and `.deia/templates/FLIGHT-PLAN.md` as minimal 1-page templates.
3) Prepare a follow-on flight plan to map legacy sprint fields (e.g., in `backlog.json`) to Season/Flight terminology.
