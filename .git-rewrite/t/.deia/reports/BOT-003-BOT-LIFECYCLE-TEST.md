**Status:** ✅ PASS

---

## Test 3: Rapid Launch/Stop Cycle

**Test:** Launch/stop 10 times in succession
- ✅ All cycles complete
- ✅ No hangs
- ✅ No resource leaks
- ✅ Consistent timing
- ✅ No corruption

**Performance:** 10 cycles = 11 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS

- ✅ No deadlocks
- ✅ No conflicts
- ✅ All operations complete
- ✅ System stable

**Status:** ✅ PASS

---

## Test 8: Bot Restart Behavior

**Test:** Stop and restart same bot

- ✅ Full restart
- ✅ Fresh state
- ✅ History preserved
- ✅ New PID assigned
- ✅ Fully operational

**Status:** ✅ PASS

---

## Key Metrics
