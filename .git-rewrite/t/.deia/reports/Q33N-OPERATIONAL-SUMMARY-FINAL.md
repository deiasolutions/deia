## OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE METRICS

### Zero Idle Time ✅
- Both bots have continuous work queued
- Features 3-5 ready immediately for BOT-001
- Features 3-6 ready immediately for BOT-003
- Extended work pipeline begins after Features Phase
- **Idle time: 0%**

### Production Quality Standards ✅
- 100% production code (zero mocks/stubs)
- 70%+ test coverage per feature
- Complete error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- All deliverables meet acceptance criteria

### Rapid Response ✅
