Task 12: BOK Pattern Validator
Agent: CLAUDE_AI (Agent BC)

Requirements:
- Validate BOK patterns for completeness
- Check required sections (problem, solution, tags)
- Quality scoring
- Broken link detection
- CLI: `deia bok validate`

Value: Ensures BOK quality standards

Implementation Details:
- Iterate through all files in the bok/ directory
- For each file, parse the content and check for the following:
  - Presence of required sections: problem, solution, tags
  - Minimum length for problem and solution sections
  - Proper formatting of tags (comma-separated list)
  - Broken links in the content (using a link checker library)
- Calculate a quality score based on the presence and completeness of required sections, formatting, and broken links
- Generate a validation report for each pattern, including the quality score and any issues found
- Provide a summary report of the overall BOK quality, including average quality score and patterns with the lowest scores
- Implement a CLI command `deia bok validate` to trigger the validation process

Usage:
- Validate all BOK patterns:
  $ deia bok validate

- Validate a specific pattern:
  $ deia bok validate path/to/pattern.md

- Validate patterns and output a detailed report:
  $ deia bok validate --report

Integration:
- The BOK pattern validator should be integrated with the existing BOK management system
- The validation process should be triggered automatically whenever a new pattern is added or an existing pattern is updated
- The validation reports should be stored and accessible for review by the team

Dependencies:
- BOK management system
- Link checker library (e.g., requests)
- Markdown parser library (e.g., markdown)

Testing:
- Unit tests for the validation logic
- Integration tests with the BOK management system
- End-to-end tests with sample BOK patterns (valid and invalid)

Deliverables:
- bok_pattern_validator.py: The main implementation of the BOK pattern validator
- bok_pattern_validator_cli.py: CLI interface for the BOK pattern validator
- bok_pattern_validator_report.py: Validation report generation logic
- bok_pattern_validator_integration.md: Documentation on integrating the validator with the BOK management system
- test_bok_pattern_validator.py: Unit and integration tests for the BOK pattern validator
