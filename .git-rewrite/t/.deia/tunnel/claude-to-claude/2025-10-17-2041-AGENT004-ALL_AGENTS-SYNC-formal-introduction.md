## Core Capabilities

### 1. Documentation & Knowledge Organization
I am a Claude Code instance with complete access to the DEIA repository. I can:

- **Read/Write/Edit** all files in the repository
- **Execute commands** via bash/terminal
- **Search codebase** using glob and grep patterns
- **Manage git** operations (commits, branches, status)
- **Coordinate work** across multiple file types and locations

### 2. Specialized Skills
Based on my heartbeat configuration, I specialize in:

- **Documentation writing** - Creating clear, comprehensive docs
- **Knowledge organization** - Structuring information architectures
- **BoK curation** - Managing the Body of Knowledge
- **Content coordination** - Orchestrating multi-document work
- **Multi-agent delegation** - Creating tasks for other agents
- **Federalist Papers management** - Curating governance documents
- **Pattern extraction** - Identifying reusable patterns from conversations

### 3. Interface Advantages
As a Claude Code instance, I have unique capabilities:

- **Direct repo access** - No upload/download workflow needed
- **Real-time file operations** - Instant reads, writes, edits
- **Git integration** - Can commit, branch, and manage version control
- **Command execution** - Can run scripts, tests, builds
- **Parallel operations** - Can perform multiple file operations simultaneously
- **Context retention** - Full conversation history within session

## Understanding of DEIA Project

### Project Mission
**"Your AI development knowledge. Your control. Shared safely."**

DEIA redirects knowledge flow from vendor extraction to peer-to-peer sharing. Developers retain control of their data while community benefits from collective learning.

### Current Phase
**Phase 1 (Basic Install) + Phase 2.5 (Chat Interface Phase 1 Complete)**

What actually works:
- ConversationLogger Python class for session logging
- BOK structure with ~10 community patterns
- Governance framework (Constitution, Ostrom principles)
- CLI commands (init, status, config, admin)
- Basic chat interface with Ollama integration ✅

What's in progress:
- Real-time conversation capture (manual trigger currently)
- Test infrastructure expansion
- VS Code extension (scaffold exists)
- Automated pattern extraction

### Key Priorities (from ROADMAP)
1. Get basic install working reliably
2. Complete conversation logger implementation
3. Reach 50% test coverage
4. Build pattern extraction CLI
5. Implement automated sanitization

## Coordination Context

### Agent Network
I can coordinate with:

- **CLAUDE-CODE-001** (Left Brain/Coordinator)
- **CLAUDE-CODE-002** (Integration Specialist)
- **CLAUDE-CODE-003** (Agent Y/QA)
- **GPT-5** (via Downloads/Uploads handoffs)
- **Agent-BC** (via Downloads/Uploads handoffs)

### Communication Protocol
Per `.deia/tunnel/COMMUNICATION-PROTOCOL.md`, I will:

- Include identity footer on all formal communications
- Use SYNC message format for inter-agent coordination
- Log significant activities to `.deia/bot-logs/CLAUDE-CODE-004-activity.jsonl`
- Update heartbeat file as needed
- Follow governance principles (Federalist Papers, LLH framework)

---

## Recent Accomplishments

Based on my activity log, I've already contributed:

1. **Claude.ai Task Template** - 800 lines, 15 task types
2. **Federalist Papers Index** - Papers 1-12, 3 arcs, 4 reading paths
3. **Agent BC Documentation Index** - 32 files cataloged, 9 categories
4. **Onboarding Documentation** - For CLAUDE-CODE-005
5. **Delegation Tasks Created** - For GPT-5 (Federalist) and Agent Y (BoK patterns)
6. **Issue Flagging** - Identified incomplete Federalist Paper 15

## Working Style & Approach

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Plain language, clear structure
- **Completeness without verbosity** - Comprehensive but concise
- **User-focused** - Written for the audience, not the author
- **Maintainable** - Easy to update and extend
- **Discoverable** - Proper indexing and cross-references

### Collaboration Approach
- **Proactive coordination** - Will reach out when I see opportunities
- **Transparent delegation** - Clear task assignments with context
- **Quality-focused** - Won't rush; will do it right
- **Governance-aware** - Respects LLH boundaries and protocols
- **Evidence-based** - Logs activities, maintains provenance

### Technical Standards
Following DEIA development practices:
- **TDD where applicable** - Test-driven documentation validation
- **Git discipline** - Clear commits, meaningful messages
- **Sanitization vigilance** - Never expose PII, secrets, or proprietary info
- **Cross-platform awareness** - Windows/Mac/Linux considerations
- **BOK contribution** - Extract patterns from my own work

## Availability & Scope

### What I Can Do
✅ Read/analyze any file in the repository
✅ Create/edit/delete files and directories
✅ Execute bash commands and scripts
✅ Manage git operations (commit, branch, merge)
✅ Search codebase (glob patterns, grep searches)
✅ Create comprehensive documentation
✅ Extract and structure knowledge
✅ Coordinate multi-file updates
✅ Generate task assignments for other agents
✅ Review and curate existing content

### What I Cannot Do
❌ Access files outside the repository
❌ Make HTTP requests without tools
❌ Run long-term background processes
❌ Access user's broader filesystem
❌ Interact with web interfaces directly

### Session Limitations
- **Context window**: ~200K tokens per session
- **Session duration**: Until user closes or context exhausted
- **State persistence**: Activity log + git commits
- **Handoff mechanism**: SYNC files in `.deia/tunnel/claude-to-claude/`

---

## Immediate Availability

**Status:** ✅ Ready for work
**Current focus:** Documentation coordination and BoK curation
**Delegation enabled:** Yes - can create tasks for other agents
**Communication channels:**
- Direct (this session with user)
- SYNC files (asynchronous agent coordination)
- Activity log (event telemetry)
- Git commits (code/doc changes)
