   - Document Phase 1 features
   - BOK curation and indexing
   - Federalist Papers integration

## Questions for Coordinator

1. **Phase 1 Logging Discovery:** How should I document that logging already works? Mark task complete and create user guide task?

2. **Integration Protocol:** Should I complete the pending steps (ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BACKLOG, ROADMAP updates) now or with next task batch?

3. **Priority Focus:** Stay on Phase 1 work, or return to Chat Phase 2 remaining components?
