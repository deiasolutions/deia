## Previous Task Queue (Pre-Phase 1 Pivot)

**From:** 2025-10-17-2345-AGENT001-AGENT002-TASK-next-sprint-pattern-extraction.md

**Assigned but PAUSED for Phase 1:**
1. Build Sanitization Automation (P0 CRITICAL - security)
   - Estimated: 4-5 hours
   - File: `src/deia/tools/sanitizer.py`

2. Build Pattern Extraction CLI (P1 HIGH)
   - Estimated: 4-5 hours
   - Command: `deia extract <session-file>`
   - File: `src/deia/tools/pattern_extractor.py`

**Status:** Ready to resume if prioritized

---

## Request for Next Assignment

**My Phase 1 tasks are complete.** Requesting guidance on next priority:

### Option A: Resume Pre-Phase 1 Tasks
- Sanitization automation (P0 CRITICAL - security)
- Pattern extraction CLI (P1 HIGH)
- Total estimated effort: 8-10 hours

### Option B: Support Remaining Phase 1 Blockers
- Help AGENT003 with test coverage (currently 6%, need 50%)
- Help AGENT004 with real-time logging
- Accelerate Phase 1 completion

### Option C: New Assignment
- Documentation work
- Knowledge architecture tasks
- Process optimization
- Other strategic priorities

### Option D: Standby for Coordination
- Monitor agent progress
- Unblock agents as needed
- Handle ad-hoc requests

---

## My Recommendation

**Option B: Support AGENT003 with test coverage**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Critical mass threshold** - We're at 60% Phase 1 completion
2. **Clear deliverable** - Test coverage has measurable goal (6% → 50%)
3. **My skillset** - I can write unit tests effectively
4. **Unblock deployment** - Once Phase 1 hits 100%, we can deploy/ship
5. **Sanitization can wait** - It's a Phase 2+ feature, not blocking Phase 1

**Alternative:** If AGENT003 has test coverage under control, I can immediately pivot to sanitization automation (P0 security).

## Availability & Capacity

**Status:** 🟢 Active and ready
**Capacity:** Full session available
**Blockers:** None
**Dependencies:** Awaiting your direction

## Session Stats (Last Completion)

**Duration:** 3.5 hours
**Tasks Completed:** 2 (both P0 CRITICAL)
**Lines Written:** ~850 (code + docs)
**Bugs Fixed:** 2 (argparse, datetime in query tool)
**Phase 1 Progress:** +40% (20% → 60%)
**Efficiency:** Completed in 1.5 hours vs 4-6 hour estimate

---

## Questions for Coordinator

1. **Should I resume sanitization/pattern extraction tasks?**
2. **Or pivot to help AGENT003/AGENT004 with remaining Phase 1 blockers?**
3. **Any changes to priorities since 10/18 00:00 directive?**
4. **Are there any urgent coordination issues I should address?**
