3. `2025-10-25-1905-000-003-DEEP-ANALYTICS-BATCH.md` (5 tasks, 8.5h)

### Completed Work (Sprint 2 + Features 1-2)

**Previous BOT-001 Delivered:**
- ✅ Sprint 2: Error handling, logging, registry, resources, shutdown, load management
- ✅ Feature 1: Task orchestration (routing, analysis, load balancing)
- ✅ Feature 2: Dynamic bot scaling (auto-spawn, resource-aware)

**Status:** All integrated, tested, production-ready.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Bot-Hours Assigned | 58.5 | On Track |
| Features Delivered (Sprint 2) | 2/5 | 40% |
| Features Queued | 3/5 | 60% |
| Infrastructure Tasks | 15 | In Queue |
| Production Hardening | 5 | In Queue |
| Documentation | In Progress | Good |

---

## Known Status

### Working Well
- Task orchestration and routing
- Dynamic scaling logic
- Health monitoring infrastructure
- Logging and observability foundation

### In Progress
- BOT-001 (new instance) doing bootcamp
- BOT-003 building monitoring suite
- All services integrating cleanly

### Next Priorities
1. Get new BOT-001 onboarded (bootcamp → Features 3-5)
2. BOT-003 execute monitoring tasks
3. Monitor for any blockers
4. Plan Phase 3+ architecture

---

## Q33N Duties (Me)

While bots execute:
- ✅ Monitor task execution (watch for blockers)
- ✅ Maintain task queue (create new assignments as needed)
- ✅ Coordinate between bots (prevent conflicts)
- ✅ Respond to status reports (give feedback/next steps)
- ✅ Emergency response (fix crashes, resolve blockers)
- ✅ Strategic planning (design Phase 3+)
- ✅ Keep system tidy (organize files, logs, documentation)

---

## File Organization

**DEIA Task Assignments:** `.deia/hive/tasks/` (root level)
**DEIA Status Reports:** `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/` (per-bot)
**System Logs:** `.deia/bot-logs/` (JSON format, all services)
**Governance:** `.deia/governance/` (Q33N decisions, org structure)
**Protocols:** `.deia/protocols/` (How things work)

---

## Next Actions

1. **Monitor BOT-001 bootcamp** - Ensure new instance reads and understands
2. **Monitor BOT-003 execution** - First batch of monitoring tasks
3. **Await status reports** - Check `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/` for updates
4. **Plan Phase 3** - What's next after Features/Monitoring complete?

**Q33N Operational. All systems go.**
