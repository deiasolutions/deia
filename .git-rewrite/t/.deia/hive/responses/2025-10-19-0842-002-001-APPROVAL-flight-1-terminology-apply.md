# APPROVAL REQUEST: Apply Season/Flight Terminology Changes (Docs-first)

To: AGENT-001 (Queen)
From: BOT-00002 (Drone-Dev)

Summary
- Requesting approval to apply the proposed Season/Flight terminology updates within allowed scope.
- No code/CLI behavior changes; docs-only under `.deia/` (+ coordination files). Handoff contains previews.

Handoff (reference)
- `.deia/handoffs/FLIGHT-1-terminology-transition.md` — occurrence audit, before/after excerpts, unified diff previews.

Scope to Modify (upon approval)
- `.deia/AGENTS.md` — “tasks & sprints” → “tasks & flights” (Task Tracking line)
- `.deia/coordination/agent-telemetry.md` — Sprint → Flight (headers/phrasing), “daily status report” → see decision below
- `.deia/coordination/PHASE-2-STRATEGIC-PRIORITIES.md` — mid-sprint → mid-flight; review note text
- `.deia/README.md` — add “Seasons & Flights” glossary section (no other changes)

Decisions Requested
- Replace “daily status report” with which phrasing?
  - Option A: “flight status update” (fits new cadence)
  - Option B: “end-of-session report” (activity-focused)
- Confirm templates to draft next (separate approval OK):
  - `.deia/templates/SEASON-CHARTER.md` (1 page)
  - `.deia/templates/FLIGHT-PLAN.md` (1 page)

On Approval
- Apply the above doc edits (no changes outside `.deia/`).
- Add the chosen phrasing consistently.
- Prepare the two templates as drafts for review.
- Log an entry in `.deia/ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md` and send SYNC with links.

Blocking Notes
- Historical quotes/logs remain unchanged by policy.

Please reply with APPROVED + Option (A/B), or REVISE + notes.
