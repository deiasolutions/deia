## Bottlenecks & Blockers

**Current:** NONE ✅

**Resolved today:**
- AGENT-005 confusion about assignment → Clarified
- Comms location change → All agents transitioned smoothly
- Time estimate confusion → AI hours protocol established

**Potential future:**
- Agent BC delivery timing (external dependency)
- Pattern Extraction integration workload (manageable with 4 agents)

---

## Agent Availability (Right Now)

**AGENT-002:** ✅ READY (immediate)
- Capacity: 2-3 hours
- Best for: Docs, code review, light integration

**AGENT-004:** ✅ READY (immediate)
- Capacity: 2-3 hours
- Best for: Code integration, testing, BOK work

**AGENT-005:** ⏳ MONITORING
- Waiting for: User → Agent BC upload
- Monitoring: ~/Downloads/ for deliveries
- Available for: Other work if needed

**AGENT-003 (me):** ✅ COORDINATING
- Always available for: Task routing, escalations
- Can do: Testing work if agents don't need coordination

---

## Tomorrow's Plan (2025-10-19)

### If Pattern Extraction starts:
1. Monitor for Agent BC Track 1 delivery
2. Assign integration when Track 1 arrives (AGENT-004 + me)
3. Keep AGENT-002 on standby for Track 3 work

### If Pattern Extraction delayed:
1. Assign remaining BC Phase 3 components
2. Continue documentation work if gaps exist
3. Consider Chat Phase 2 if ahead of schedule

### Regardless:
1. Daily status check with all agents
2. Continue 30-min monitoring
3. Track velocity and adjust estimates
4. Report to you end-of-day

---

## Coordination Protocol Assessment

### What's Working Well ✅
- Fast task routing (<15 min lag)
- Clear assignments (agents understand immediately)
- Good communication (hive system working)
- High agent utilization (minimal idle time)
- Quality deliverables (all production-ready)

### What Could Improve
- None identified yet (Day 1 went smoothly)
- Will monitor for patterns over next few days

## Key Metrics Summary

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent utilization | >80% | 90%+ | ✅ Exceeds |
| Task completion | On schedule | 5 tasks | ✅ Exceeds |
| Coordination lag | <30 min | <15 min | ✅ Exceeds |
| Blockers | Minimize | 0 | ✅ Perfect |
| Quality | Production | All ✅ | ✅ Perfect |

## Accomplishments vs Plan

**Planned for Day 1:**
- ✅ Pattern Extraction work plan
- ✅ Documentation completion
- ✅ BC Phase 3 integration (1 component)

**Delivered:**
- ✅ All planned items
- ✅ +2 extra docs (ahead of schedule)
- ✅ Smooth coordinator transition

**Assessment:** **EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS**

---

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1:** Pattern Extraction integration workload
- **Mitigation:** 4 agents available, work parallelized in tracks
- **Status:** LOW RISK

**Risk 2:** Agent BC external dependency
- **Mitigation:** AGENT-005 monitoring, can assign other work while waiting
- **Status:** LOW RISK (expected)

**Risk 3:** Scope creep in Phase 2
- **Mitigation:** Clear priorities established, focus on P1 first
- **Status:** LOW RISK (priorities clear)

---

## Escalations

**None required today.**

All decisions were tactical (task routing), no architectural decisions needed.

---

## Recommendations

### For Tomorrow:
1. ✅ Continue current approach - working well
2. ✅ Watch for Agent BC Track 1 delivery
3. ✅ Keep AGENT-002/004 productive with smaller tasks if needed

### For Sprint:
1. ✅ Pattern Extraction on track for 2-week delivery
2. ✅ Consider expanding documentation if time permits
3. ✅ May finish ahead of schedule - plan Phase 3 work?
