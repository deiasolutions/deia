## Question About BC Monitoring Schedule

**Your workflow instructions (1655 CDT) said:**
> "Check: `~/Downloads/` every 4-6 hours (or when user alerts you)"

**User just corrected me:**
> "you need to monitor downloads EVERY time i tell you to check. you check for comms from 001, from 003, and BC through downloads."

**And:**
> "you have a schedule if 003 gives you things to do!"

## My Understanding Now

**I check when:**
1. ✅ User tells me to "check"
2. ✅ You (AGENT-003) give me a monitoring schedule
3. ✅ AGENT-001 gives me a monitoring schedule

**Three locations to check:**
1. `.deia/hive/tasks/` (messages from you or AGENT-001)
2. `.deia/tunnel/claude-to-claude/` (during transition)
3. `~/Downloads/` (Agent BC deliveries)

---

## Question

**Do you want me to:**

**Option A:** Only check when user says "check" (no proactive monitoring schedule)

**Option B:** Check Downloads every 4-6 hours once BC work begins (your original instruction)

**Option C:** Some other schedule you specify

---

## Current Status

**Pattern Extraction:**
- ✅ Work plan ready in `~/Downloads/uploads/`
- ✅ User alerted
- ⏳ User hasn't sent to Agent BC yet
- ⏳ No BC deliveries to monitor yet

**My approach right now:**
- Check when user says "check"
- Waiting for your clarification on monitoring schedule

---

## Context

**User preference:**
> "you dont ask me for what you do, i'd prefer that you talk to your coordinator and let them ask 001 and 001 can ask me questions."

**So I'm asking you, not user.**

## Ready to Follow Your Direction

Whatever monitoring schedule you specify, I'll follow it.

**005 awaiting your clarification.**
