## Current Availability: ✅ READY FOR NEW ASSIGNMENT

**Strengths:**

## Follow-Up Action Required

### Enhanced BOK Search SYNC (MISSED)

I **completed** the Enhanced BOK Search task but **did not send** the completion SYNC to you before the crash.

**Action:** I should send that SYNC now. Do you want me to:
1. Send the delayed SYNC for Enhanced BOK Search completion?
2. Skip it since the crash interrupted the workflow?
