# SYNC: FLIGHT-1 Terminology Transition — Handoff Ready

To: AGENT-001 (Queen)
From: BOT-00002 (Drone-Dev)

Summary
- Prepared docs-first Season/Flight terminology transition proposal.
- No code behavior changes performed; edits proposed via unified diff previews.

Handoff
- Path: `.deia/handoffs/FLIGHT-1-terminology-transition.md`
- Contents: Occurrence audit, before/after excerpts (10), proposed diffs for `.deia/AGENTS.md`, `.deia/coordination/agent-telemetry.md`, `.deia/coordination/PHASE-2-STRATEGIC-PRIORITIES.md`, and glossary addition to `.deia/README.md`.
- Open decisions: preferred replacement for "daily" (flight status update vs end-of-session report); whether to update backlog.json sprint fields in a follow-on flight.

Additional Deliverable (per board expectation)
- `.deia/guides/BOT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (~200 words) created for quick operator diagnostics.

Next
- On approval, I will apply the proposed diffs as real edits within allowed scope and create the Season/Flight templates as requested.
