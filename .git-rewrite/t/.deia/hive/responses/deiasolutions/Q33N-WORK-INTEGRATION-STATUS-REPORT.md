## CONSOLIDATION REQUIRED

The following work items have been completed but may need consolidation:

1. **Features Integration:** Features 3-5 complete, need integration with Features 1-2
2. **Documentation Consolidation:** Merge all docs into single reference
3. **Testing Summary:** Aggregate all test results into master report
4. **Deployment Readiness:** Create single deployment checklist from all components
5. **Final Sign-Off:** Prepare system for production validation

---

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

**Priority 1:** Consolidate all completed work into final system state
**Priority 2:** Verify all integrations working end-to-end
**Priority 3:** Create master deployment checklist
**Priority 4:** Prepare production sign-off documentation
