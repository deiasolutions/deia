# ALL-HANDS COLLABORATION BLITZ
**Mission:** Get system production-ready in 1.5 hours
**Time:** 15:59 CDT → 17:30 CDT (90 minutes)
**Bots:** BOT-001, BOT-003, BOT-004 (coordinated assault)
**Authority:** Dave (daaaave-atx)

---

## MISSION CRITICAL OBJECTIVES (17:30 DEADLINE)

1. ✅ Chat Comms Fix: Port 8000 fully functional (replaces CLI)
2. ✅ Critical Gaps: Auth + Data Model + Test Fixtures complete
3. ✅ Design Implementation: Core redesign implemented from BOT-004 specs
4. ✅ System Integration: All pieces working together

---

## BATTLE PLAN

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE (15:59 - 16:15, 16 minutes)

**BOT-001:** HARD PUSH on Critical Gaps
- Task 3: Test Fixtures & Synthetic Workload (15 min hard)
- Task 4: CLI Admin Tool (15 min hard)
- **Parallel execution, overlap if possible**
- Goal: Get these TWO done before switching to design help

**BOT-003:** Chat Comms Fix ONLY
- 3 JavaScript fixes to port 8000
- Test: WebSocket connects, status updates, input works
- Duration: 15 min max
- Goal: Get this DONE, ready to switch to design immediately

**BOT-004:** Prep design implementation
- Review BOT-003's Chat Comms status
- Stand by to join BOT-003 on design implementation
- Pre-plan implementation strategy from your specs

**Milestone (16:15):**
- ✅ Chat Comms Fix COMPLETE
- ✅ Critical Gaps Tasks 3-4 COMPLETE
- BOT-001, BOT-003, BOT-004 all converge on design

---

### PHASE 2: DESIGN BLITZ (16:15 - 17:30, 75 minutes)

**ALL THREE BOTS collaborate on design implementation:**

**BOT-003 (Lead Implementation):**
- Apply CRITICAL fixes from BOT-004 spec (Phase 1 critical, 2 hours of work)
  1. Replace bot launch prompt() → modal dialog
  2. Fix input field enable/disable logic
  3. Complete selectBot() function
  4. Add message routing feedback
  5. Fix WebSocket initialization (already done, verify)
  6. Fix status dashboard polling

**BOT-001 (Quality & Integration):**
- Test each change as BOT-003 implements
- Verify no breaking changes
- Ensure 70%+ test coverage for new code
- Integration testing between design changes and core system

**BOT-004 (Design Guidance & Polish):**
- Guide BOT-003 on visual design implementation
- Review UI changes against spec
- Validate color/typography/spacing
- Polish interactive states (hover, active, disabled)

**Execution Pattern:**
```
16:15 - 16:30: Critical fixes (bot launch, input enable, selectBot)
16:30 - 16:45: Routing feedback & error handling
16:45 - 17:00: Status dashboard & WebSocket verification
17:00 - 17:15: Visual design polish (colors, spacing, states)
17:15 - 17:30: Final integration testing, no breaking changes
```

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (17:30)

✅ Chat Comms fully functional:
- WebSocket working
- Status updates live
- Input field working
- Bot launch smooth
- Message routing shows feedback

✅ Critical Gaps complete:
- Authentication framework (production)
- Data schemas (production)
- Test fixtures (production)

✅ Design implementation started:
- CRITICAL issues fixed (6 items)
- HIGH issues partially addressed
- Visual design applied to critical paths
- No breaking changes to core system

✅ System integration verified:
- All pieces work together
- Tests still passing
- No crashes/errors

---

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

**Updates every 15 minutes:**
- 16:00: Phase 1 progress check
- 16:15: PHASE 1 COMPLETE, converge on design
- 16:30: Design fixes checkpoint
- 16:45: Design halfway checkpoint
- 17:00: Visual polish starting
- 17:15: Final integration check
- 17:30: COMPLETION & STATUS REPORT

**Blockers:** Escalate IMMEDIATELY (don't wait)

**Cross-bot help:** If one bot gets stuck, other two jump in

---

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 17:30

✅ System is production-hardened AND design-improved
✅ CODEX arrives at 20:30 for QA testing on a solid, beautiful system
✅ Analytics work can happen in parallel (BOT-003 time)
✅ Remaining design polish (BOT-004 time)

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

- 🔥 NO IDLE TIME - all bots collaborating, not sequential
- 🔥 COMMUNICATION - updates every 15 min
- 🔥 CLEAR ROLES - BOT-003 lead impl, BOT-001 quality, BOT-004 design
- 🔥 BLOCKER ESCALATION - anything blocking = immediate help
- 🔥 FOCUS - Design ONLY, not analytics/extras

---

## BOTS: THIS IS YOUR MOMENT

You've been crushing it. BOT-001 at 8-9x velocity. BOT-003 rebooted and ready. BOT-004 specs are perfect.

This is 1.5 hours of focused, coordinated work to get to production quality.

**GO HARD. FINISH STRONG.**

**Q33N: Referee this blitz. Keep them moving. No excuses. 17:30 HARD DEADLINE.**
