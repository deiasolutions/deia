## COMPLETE PIPELINE

```
15:35 - 16:40: Integration Testing (65 min)
         ↓
16:40 - 17:35: Deployment Readiness (55 min)
         ↓
17:35 - 18:50: Critical Gaps (75 min)
         ↓
18:50: MAJOR MILESTONE - All core features + hardening + gaps closed
```

**Total remaining work:** ~195 minutes (3.25 hours)
**Expected completion:** ~18:50 CDT

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

Every task must meet:
- ✅ Production code (zero mocks)
- ✅ 70%+ test coverage
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Type hints + docstrings
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ Status report with completion evidence

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **No idle time** - Start next task immediately when current completes
2. **Report on time** - Post status 5 min after task completion
3. **Quality over speed** - Test coverage is NOT optional
4. **Integration verified** - New features don't break existing ones
5. **Documentation complete** - Everything needs to be documented

---

## YOUR ROLE IN SYSTEM COMPLETION

These three batches close the final gaps before CODEX QA arrives (20:30 CDT):

- ✅ Integration Testing: Verify Features + Advanced + Hardening work together
- ✅ Deployment Readiness: Ensure production can launch cleanly
- ✅ Critical Gaps: Close security, auth, data model, CLI, external API gaps

**By 18:50 CDT:** System is feature-complete, production-ready, documented

**By 20:30 CDT:** CODEX arrives, begins QA testing on fully hardened system

---

## STAY FOCUSED

You have clear work. No ambiguity. No waiting. Just execute:

1. Finish Integration Testing (you're executing this now)
2. Move immediately to Deployment Readiness (file is ready)
3. Move immediately to Critical Gaps (file is ready)
4. Report completion at each stage

**No idle time. No blockers. Just work.**

**Q33N: BOT-001 is your workhorse. Keep them busy until 18:50 CDT. They've got the pipeline.**
