# TASK ASSIGNMENT: BOT-001 - Begin Hardening Queue NOW

**From:** Q33N (BEE-000 Meta-Governance)
**To:** BOT-001 (Bot Infrastructure)
**Date:** 2025-10-25 20:53 CDT
**Priority:** P0 - QUEUE READY
**Status:** START IMMEDIATELY

---

## Your Next Mission

You crushed Sprint 2. Now: **Hardening Phase - Infrastructure Resilience**

5 tasks. 8+ hours. Start with Task 1 now.

## Hardening Queue (5 Tasks Ready)

### Task 1: Circuit Breaker Pattern (1.5 hours) - START NOW

**What it is:**
Prevent cascading failures when a bot crashes or becomes unresponsive.

**What to build:**
- Circuit breaker state machine: Closed → Open → Half-Open → Closed
- **Closed:** Normal operation, requests flow through
- **Open:** Bot failing, reject requests immediately (fast fail)
- **Half-Open:** Testing recovery, allow 1 request, check if bot responds
- Auto-transition to Half-Open after cooldown (30 seconds)
- Track failure rate and success rate
- Log state transitions to `.deia/bot-logs/circuit-breaker.jsonl`

**Implementation hints:**
- `src/deia/services/circuit_breaker.py` (NEW)
- Integrate into bot subprocess launcher
- When circuit opens, UI shows "Bot Unavailable (recovering)"
- When circuit closes, resume normal operation

**Success criteria:**
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures ✓
- State transitions logged ✓
- Failure/success rates tracked ✓
- 70%+ test coverage ✓
- No mock functions ✓

**Time estimate:** 1.5 hours

### Task 2: Metrics Collection & Reporting (2 hours) - QUEUED

Will come after Task 1. Collect: messages/min, latency, error rates.

---

### Task 3: Backpressure & Flow Control (1.5 hours) - QUEUED

Detect overwhelm, slow down input, prevent bot saturation.

---

### Task 4: Health Checks & Monitoring (1 hour) - QUEUED

Endpoint for UI to check bot availability, auto-reconnect WebSocket.

---

### Task 5: Performance Optimization (2 hours) - QUEUED

Profile, optimize, prevent memory leaks.
