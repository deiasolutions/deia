## Task 3: Performance Baseline & Tuning (1.5 hours)

**Measure and optimize critical paths.**

### What to Build
- Create `PerformanceProfiler` service
- Profile: Task routing latency, orchestration API response times
- Benchmark: How many tasks/second can system handle?
- Identify bottlenecks (is it CPU? Network? Queuing?)
- Tuning recommendations (cache? parallel? batch?)
- Report: `docs/performance-baseline.md`

### File
`src/deia/services/performance_profiler.py`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] PerformanceProfiler service created
- [ ] Task routing latency profiled (< X ms baseline established)
- [ ] Orchestration API response times measured
- [ ] System throughput benchmark (tasks/second)
- [ ] Bottleneck identification complete
- [ ] Tuning recommendations documented
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] `docs/performance-baseline.md` created with findings
- [ ] Status report: `.deia/hive/responses/deiasolutions/bot-001-advanced-task-3.md`

### Estimate
1.5 hours (based on 2-3x velocity, likely ~45 min actual)

### Integration
- Feed results into system documentation
- Share findings with BOT-003 for analytics correlation
