# TASK ASSIGNMENT: BOT-003 - Deep Analytics Batch
**From:** Q33N (BEE-000)
**To:** BOT-003 (Infrastructure Analytics)
**Date:** 2025-10-25 19:05 CDT
**Priority:** P0
**Status:** 5 Analytics Tasks Ready

---

## Task 1: Anomaly Detection Engine (2 hours)

**Spot unusual patterns before they become problems.**

- Create `AnomalyDetector` service
- Detect: Unusual task latency, queue depth, bot behavior
- Methods: Statistical baseline + machine learning (if available)
- Alert: Probabilistic alerts (80% confident = alert)
- Root cause: Suggest possible causes for anomalies
- Logging to `anomalies-detected.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/anomaly_detector.py`
**Success:** Catch 70% of emerging problems before they fail

---

## Task 2: Correlational Analysis (1.5 hours)

**Find what factors affect system behavior.**

- Create `CorrelationAnalyzer` service
- Questions: Does CPU load correlate with task failures? Is queue depth growing?
- Analyze: Historical patterns (last 7 days, 30 days)
- Report: Correlation matrix (what affects what)
- Predictions: If X happens, Y will likely happen
- Logging to `correlation-analysis.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/correlation_analyzer.py`
**Success:** Understand system cause-and-effect relationships

---

## Task 3: Heat Maps & Visualizations (1.5 hours)

**Generate data for dashboards.**

- Create `HeatMapGenerator` service
- Generate: Time-of-day heatmaps (when is system busiest?)
- Generate: Bot-usage heatmaps (which bots most used?)
- Generate: Task-type heatmaps (what tasks are common?)
- Format: JSON for frontend visualization
- Logging to `heatmap-data.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/heatmap_generator.py`
**Success:** Dashboard can visualize system patterns over time

---

## Task 4: Comparative Analysis (2 hours)

**Compare system behavior across time periods.**

- Create `ComparativeAnalyzer` service
- Compare: Today vs. yesterday, this week vs. last week
- Metrics: Throughput, latency, errors, resource usage
- Report: What changed? Is it good or bad?
- Trending: Is system getting better or worse?
- Logging to `comparative-reports.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/comparative_analyzer.py`
**Success:** Track improvement/degradation over time

---

## Task 5: Optimization Recommendations (1.5 hours)

**AI-driven suggestions for system improvement.**

- Create `OptimizationAdvisor` service
- Analyze: Current performance, bottlenecks, resource waste
- Recommend: Specific changes (increase X, decrease Y)
- Estimate: Expected improvement (CPU usage down 20%, etc.)
- Prioritize: Which optimizations have highest ROI
- Logging to `optimization-recommendations.jsonl`

**File:** `src/deia/services/optimization_advisor.py`
**Success:** System self-identifies improvement opportunities

---

**Estimated total: 8.5 hours**

**Deep analytics. Do these after initial observability batch.**

Go.
