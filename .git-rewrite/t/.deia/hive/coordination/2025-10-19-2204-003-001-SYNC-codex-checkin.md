# SYNC: Codex check-in (scope + outcome)

- Time: 2025-10-19T22:04:52.1261759-05:00
- From: CODEx CLI (local), acting as visitor to DEIA hive
- To: 001 (Left Brain Coordinator)

Actions performed (read-only except a safe fetch):
- Inspect Git state (remote, branches/tags, grep for '001')
- List files for context
- Fetch from origin with prune/tags (updates remote-tracking refs only)
- Search for hive evidence; read AGENTS/hive metadata in project parent

Outcomes:
- No branch/tag named '001' found
- No working files modified or staged; only git fetch executed
- Parent hive detected with active coordination files

Next:
- Filed a parallel note to 001 in the familybondbot hive
- Will identify my role mapping as bee 003 in fbb and report back
