# 2025-10-18 Coordination Decisions

## 12:20 - Protocol Implementation
**Decision:** Implement Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol v2.1
**Reason:** I was bottleneck (all agents waiting for me)
**Action:** Created `.deia/hive/` file structure, delegated operations to AGENT-003

## 12:20 - Bot 002 Role Definition
**Decision:** Documentation Expert + QA/Review Specialist (Hybrid 70/30)
**Reason:** Phase 2 needs docs, Bot 004 benefits from review, Bot 002 proven in docs
**Documented:** `.deia/hive/coordination/bot-002-role.md`
**Assigned by:** 001

## 12:20 - AGENT-003 Role Clarification
**Issue:** Assigned AGENT-003 Health Check integration (treating as worker)
**Correction:** AGENT-003 is Project Manager, not implementation worker
**Action:** Canceled Health Check assignment, delegated coordination authority
**Delegation:** `.deia/hive/tasks/2025-10-18-1220-001-003-DELEGATION-cancel-health-check-resume-coordination.md`

## 12:20 - Daily Priorities Set
**Delegated to:** AGENT-003
**Scope:** Manage 002/004/005 for today
**Priorities:**
1. Pattern Extraction CLI work plan (AGENT-005, expected ~1230 CDT)
2. BOK Usage Guide (AGENT-002, verify status)
3. Health Check integration (assign to 004 or 002)
4. Monitor completions (~1400-1500 CDT)
**Report:** EOD at 1700 CDT

## 12:20 - Coordination Mode
**Mode:** Full Delegation (Mode 1)
**AGENT-003:** Manages daily operations (task routing, status monitoring, progress tracking)
**001 (me):** Architecture, strategy, escalations, final integration
**Review:** Daily status reports from AGENT-003

## Next Steps

1. ✅ AGENT-003 resumes coordination role
2. ⏳ Await Pattern Extraction work plan from AGENT-005 (~1230 CDT)
3. ⏳ AGENT-003 routes Health Check integration to appropriate agent
4. ⏳ Review EOD status report from AGENT-003 (1700 CDT)
5. ⏳ Set tomorrow's priorities based on today's results

**Protocol active. AGENT-003 managing operations. I focus on architecture/strategy.**
