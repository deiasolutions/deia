## What is iDea?

**iDea** is an agile sprint framework designed for productive human-AI collaborative software development. It combines traditional Agile/Scrum principles with AI-specific workflows, creating a structured approach for teams where AI tools act as active development partners rather than passive assistants.

**Key Innovation:** Treats AI as a first-class team member with defined roles, responsibilities, and workflows.

**Unified Methodology:** DEIA + iDea = Complete cycle from documentation through execution

## Core Principles

1. **Documentation-Driven Development** - Document as you build, not after
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Tests before code, always
3. **Clean-as-You-Go** - Never defer cleanup or refactoring
4. **AI as Team Member** - Active contributor with defined responsibilities
5. **Cross-Session Continuity** - Persistent memory through documentation

---

## Team Structure

### Human Roles (Strategic Leadership)
- **Chief Architect** - Final decision authority
- **Product Owner** - Priorities and acceptance criteria
- **UAT Tester** - Critical user flow validation
- **Visionary** - Strategic direction

### AI Roles (Development & Execution)
- **Software Developer** - Feature implementation
- **Assistant Architect** - Technical proposals
- **Product Manager** - Progress tracking
- **Sprint Captain** - Sprint execution management
- **Communications Director** - Documentation
- **QA Engineer** - Automated testing

## Development Workflow (5 Phases)

### 1. Planning
Check documentation → Plan approach → Get approval

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Write test → Run test (fail) → Implement → Run test (pass) → Refactor

### 3. Implementation
Implement → Test → Document → Cleanup → Commit

### 4. Quality Assurance
Unit tests → Integration tests → AI testing → Human UAT → Production

### 5. Deployment
Local test → Commit → Push → CI/CD → Auto-deploy → Smoke test

---

## Sprint Structure

**Duration:** 1 week (Monday-Friday)

**Monday:** Sprint planning (30 min)
**Tuesday-Thursday:** Development with TDD
**Friday:** Sprint review + retrospective (45 min)

**Daily:** Async standups (5 min written updates)

## Why iDea Works

### Traditional Agile Problems with AI:
1. Passive role (AI as autocomplete, not team member)
2. No accountability for AI-generated code
3. Documentation gaps for AI changes
4. Testing blind spots
5. Context loss between sessions

### How iDea Solves These:
1. **Active role** - AI has defined responsibilities
2. **Clear ownership** - AI documents work, human approves
3. **Documentation first** - Every decision captured
4. **TDD enforced** - Tests before implementation
5. **Persistent memory** - Documentation provides continuity

---

## Getting Started

1. **Define team roles** (human vs AI responsibilities)
2. **Set up documentation structure** (ADRs, context files, changelog)
3. **Create initial backlog**
4. **Establish sprint schedule**
5. **Define "Definition of Done" criteria**
