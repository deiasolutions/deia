# Testing the DEIA VSCode Extension

## Quick Start

### 1. Compile the Extension

```bash
cd extensions/vscode-deia
npm install
npm run compile
```

### 2. Test in VSCode

**Method A: Launch from VSCode**
1. Open `extensions/vscode-deia` folder in VSCode
2. Press `F5` (or Run â†’ Start Debugging)
3. A new "Extension Development Host" window opens
4. The DEIA extension is loaded in this window

**Method B: Command Line**
```bash
code --extensionDevelopmentPath=./extensions/vscode-deia
```

### 3. Create a Test Project

In the Extension Development Host window:

```bash
# Create test project
mkdir ~/deia-test
cd ~/deia-test

# Initialize DEIA (if you have CLI installed)
deia init

# Or manually create structure
mkdir -p .deia/sessions
echo '{"project": "test", "auto_log": false}' > .deia/config.json
echo "# Session Index" > .deia/sessions/INDEX.md
echo "# Project Resume" > project_resume.md
```

### 4. Test Commands

Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- `DEIA: Check Status` - Should show DEIA detected
- `DEIA: Read Project Resume` - Opens `project_resume.md`
- `DEIA: View Session Logs` - Opens `.deia/sessions/` directory
- `DEIA: Toggle Auto-Logging` - Toggles auto-log on/off

### 5. Test Chat Participant

If you have a chat extension (Copilot, Continue, etc.):

1. Open chat panel
2. Type `@deia help`
3. Should show DEIA help message
4. Type `@deia status`
5. Should show configuration status
6. Type `@deia log`
7. Should log the conversation

## Manual Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time User

```
1. User installs extension
2. Opens project without DEIA
3. Runs "DEIA: Check Status"
   â†’ Should show "No DEIA-enabled workspace"
   â†’ Should suggest running "deia init"
4. User runs "deia init" in terminal
5. Extension detects new .deia/ folder
   â†’ Status bar appears
6. User runs "DEIA: Log Current Chat"
   â†’ Creates first session log
   â†’ Success!
```

### Scenario 2: Existing DEIA User

```
1. User opens existing DEIA project
2. Extension auto-detects .deia/
   â†’ Status bar shows "DEIA: Manual"
3. User reads project_resume.md
   â†’ Sees where they left off
4. User works, has chat conversation
5. User runs "@deia log"
   â†’ Conversation saved
6. User checks .deia/sessions/
   â†’ New log file exists
```

### Scenario 3: SpecKit Workflow

```
1. User has conversation about architecture
2. DEIA logs it
3. User runs "Create SpecKit Spec from Conversation"
   â†’ Picks recent log
   â†’ Names it "api-design"
4. Check specs/api-design.md
   â†’ Spec exists with extracted content
5. User runs "Add Decisions to SpecKit Constitution"
   â†’ Picks same log
   â†’ Previews decisions
   â†’ Confirms
6. Check .specify/memory/constitution.md
   â†’ Decisions added
```

### Scenario 4: Crash Recovery

```
1. User working with AI
2. "@deia log" periodically
3. VSCode crashes
4. User reopens VSCode
5. User runs "DEIA: Read Project Resume"
   â†’ Sees last session summary
6. User checks .deia/sessions/
   â†’ All logs preserved
   â†’ Context recovered
```

## Debugging

### View Extension Logs

1. `Help > Toggle Developer Tools`
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for "DEIA" messages

### Common Issues

**"Cannot find module 'vscode'"**
- Run `npm install` in `extensions/vscode-deia`

**"Command not found: deia.logChat"**
- Check `package.json` - command IDs must match
- Reload window: `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R`

**"Extension not activating"**
- Check `activationEvents` in `package.json`
- Check console for errors
- Try `Ctrl+R` to reload

**"Status bar not showing"**
- Check `deia.showStatusBar` setting
- Ensure `.deia/` directory exists
- Check extension activation in console

### Enable Verbose Logging

Add to `extension.ts`:

```typescript
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    console.log('[DEIA] Extension activating...');
    console.log('[DEIA] Workspace folders:', vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders);
    // ...
}
```

## Automated Testing (TODO)

### Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

**Test files to create:**
- `test/suite/deiaDetector.test.ts`
- `test/suite/deiaLogger.test.ts`
- `test/suite/commands.test.ts`
- `test/suite/speckitIntegration.test.ts`

### Integration Tests

Test full workflows:
- Initialize DEIA â†’ Log conversation â†’ Verify file created
- Create spec â†’ Verify SpecKit format
- Update constitution â†’ Verify content added

---

## Performance Testing

### Startup Time

Measure extension activation:

```typescript
const startTime = Date.now();
// ... activation code ...
console.log(`DEIA activated in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
```

**Target:** < 500ms activation time

### File Operations

Test with large conversation logs:
- 100 KB log file
- 1000 session files
- Should remain responsive

```bash
vsce publish
```

(Requires publisher account and PAT from Visual Studio Marketplace)

---

## Continuous Testing

### During Development

```bash
npm run watch
```

Leave this running - it recompiles on file changes.

In VSCode Extension Development Host:
- Press `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R` to reload extension after changes

### Before Each Commit

1. `npm run compile` - Ensure no TypeScript errors
2. `npm run lint` - Check code style
3. Test key commands manually
4. Check Developer Console for errors

---
