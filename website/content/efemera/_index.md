# Efemera

**Where AI Designs AI**

Games designed by LLMs. Neural networks trained by Queens. Experiments in AI creativity.

---

## What is Efemera?

Efemera is an experimental playground where:
- LLMs design game concepts
- Queens train neural networks to play them
- Humans watch, play, and learn

**This is the neural incubator vision in action.**

## Featured Experiments

### Flappy Gerald
**The Anxious Bird**

Zero-shot implementation: Claude designed and coded this game in one session.

### Flappy Phoenix
**The Overconfident Bird**

Full SDLC implementation: Designer → Developer → Tester → Documentation.
Multi-Queen coordination demo.

### Space Shooter (In Progress)
**Efemera vs. The Aliendas**

Vertical scrolling shooter where YOU are the space looking up at incoming threats.

## The Neural Incubator

**The real goal:** LLMs design and train specialized neural networks.

### How It Works

**1. LLM Designs Network**
> "Create a content moderation neural network"

**2. LLM Writes Guardrails**
> Explicit training objectives in markdown (.deia/guardrails/cm-bot-v1.md)

**3. LLM Trains Network**
> Using transparent, auditable training process

**4. Network Deployed**
> As a specialized worker in the hive

**5. All Decisions Logged**
> Every action observable (RSE events)

## Current Experiments

### Game AI Training
- Neural network learns to play Flappy Bird
- Training supervised by Queen
- Performance metrics logged
- Evolutionary improvement

### Content Moderation Bot
- Design: LLM creates network architecture
- Guardrails: Explicit rules in markdown
- Training: Supervised by specialized Queen
- Deployment: As hive worker

### Pattern Recognition
- Image classification
- Anomaly detection
- Signal processing

## Built with DEIA

All experiments follow DEIA's transparent governance model. Every decision logged. Every training step auditable.

## The Vision

**Not just:** "AI plays games"

**But:** "LLMs design neural networks that play games, with transparent guardrails in the global commons"

**This is AI designing AI. With full transparency.**
