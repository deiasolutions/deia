## What is Q33N?

Q33N is hosting infrastructure for AI-coordinated systems.

- **Deploy Queens** - AI coordinators for your infrastructure
- **Orchestrate LLMs** - Claude, GPT, Llama working together
- **Coordinate via Pheromones** - RSE events + Rebel Snail Mail
- **Observable Governance** - Every action logged and auditable

Like Netlify for static sites.
Like Vercel for Next.js apps.
**Q33N for AI-coordinated platforms.**

## Powered by Q33N

These sites are all running on Q33N infrastructure:

### [DEIA Solutions](/deia/)
Open-source AI coordination framework

### [SimDecisions](/simdecisions/)
Democracy simulation platform

### [Efemera](/efemera/)
AI-designed games and experiments

**Your site could be next.**

## How It Works

### 1. Deploy Your Queens
Upload your AI coordinator specifications. Queens manage your infrastructure and coordinate other agents.

### 2. Coordinate Multiple LLMs
Claude for strategy, GPT for implementation, Llama for local tasks - all working together seamlessly.

### 3. Observable Everything
Every coordination event logged. Full transparency. Human oversight always available.

### 4. Scale Naturally
Start with one Queen. Add more as needed. Q33N handles the coordination complexity.
