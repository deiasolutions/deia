# SimDecisions

**Democracy as Simulation**

Simulate political decisions with procedural realism. Watch how bills become law. Understand the process.

---

## What is SimDecisions?

SimDecisions is a democracy simulation platform that models real-world political processes with unprecedented accuracy.

**Key Features:**
- Procedural realism (actual House/Senate rules)
- AI-powered institutional actors (members of Congress, governors)
- Real-world scenarios (border funding, climate legislation)
- Transparent decision-making (every vote, every negotiation logged)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Select a Scenario
Choose from real-world policy challenges:
- Border Funding 2025
- Climate Legislation
- Healthcare Reform
- Budget Negotiations

### 2. Configure Actors
Customize the political landscape:
- Party composition
- Key players
- Coalition dynamics
- External pressures

### 3. Run Simulation
Watch the process unfold:
- Committee hearings
- Floor debates
- Amendment battles
- Conference negotiations
- Presidential action

### 4. Analyze Results
Understand what happened:
- Why did it pass/fail?
- What were the pivotal moments?
- How did coalitions form?
- What would change the outcome?

---

## Use Cases

### Education
Teach students how government actually works. Not theory—actual process.

### Policy Analysis
Test policy ideas before proposing them. Identify likely obstacles.

### Journalism
Explain complex political processes to readers. Make civics engaging.

### Research
Study legislative dynamics. Test hypotheses about political behavior.

## Procedural Realism

SimDecisions doesn't simplify. We model the actual rules:

- House Rules (Hastert Rule, discharge petitions, procedural motions)
- Senate Rules (filibuster, cloture, budget reconciliation)
- Conference Committees
- Presidential veto power
- Appropriations vs. Authorization

**This isn't a game. It's a training simulation.**

---

## AI-Powered Actors

Each member of Congress is an AI agent with:
- Historical voting record
- Constituency pressures
- Ideological positioning
- Coalition preferences
- Negotiation patterns

**They don't just vote. They strategize, negotiate, and respond to events.**

---

## Transparency

Every decision is logged:
- Who said what in negotiations
- Why votes changed
- What amendments were proposed
- How coalitions formed

**SimDecisions is built on DEIA's transparent governance model.**

---

## Example: Border Funding 2025

> **Scenario:** House Republicans propose $25B for border security. Can it pass?

**Simulation reveals:**
- House Freedom Caucus demands more enforcement
- Moderate Republicans want Dreamers protection
- Senate Democrats split on enforcement vs. pathways
- Compromise emerges: $18B + limited legal pathways
- Final vote: 232-203 (House), 52-48 (Senate)

**Key insight:** Deal required bipartisan Senate coalition, not House alone.
