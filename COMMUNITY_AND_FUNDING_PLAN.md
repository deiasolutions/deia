# DEIA Community & Funding Strategy

**Status:** Planning phase - Recommendations for Dave
**Purpose:** Set up funding, community platforms, feedback loops, vendor integration

---

## Category 1: Funding & Donations

### What Other Dev Projects Do

**Common platforms:**
1. **GitHub Sponsors** (Most popular for open source)
   - Built into GitHub
   - No fees (GitHub pays processing)
   - Appears on repo page
   - Monthly or one-time donations
   - ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

2. **Open Collective** (Transparent finances)
   - Shows where money goes
   - Good for foundations
   - Fiscal sponsorship available
   - 10% fee
   - ✅ **RECOMMENDED for foundation phase**

3. **Ko-fi** (Simple, low fees)
   - One-time donations
   - 0% platform fee (just payment processing)
   - Good for individuals

4. **Patreon** (Monthly subscriptions)
   - Good for content creators
   - Less common for dev tools
   - ❌ Not recommended for DEIA

5. **GoFundMe** (Campaign-based)
   - For specific goals
   - 2.9% + $0.30 fee
   - ❌ Not typical for open source

### Recommendation for DEIA

**Phase 1 (Now - 6 months):**
```markdown
GitHub Sponsors ONLY
- Set up as deiasolutions organization
- Tiers:
  - $5/month - Supporter (name in SUPPORTERS.md)
  - $25/month - Contributor (name + company logo)
  - $100/month - Sustainer (above + priority support)
  - $500/month - Partner (above + strategic input)
```

**Phase 2 (6 months - 2 years):**
```markdown
Add Open Collective
- Transparent budgeting
- Show expenses (servers, maintainers)
- Fiscal sponsorship (if forming non-profit)
```

**How to set up GitHub Sponsors:**
1. Go to github.com/sponsors
2. Set up for your personal account (daaaave-atx) OR organization (deiasolutions)
3. Create `.github/FUNDING.yml` in repo:
   ```yaml
   github: deiasolutions
   # or
   github: daaaave-atx
   ```
4. Appears as "Sponsor" button on repo

**Messaging on repo:**
```markdown
## Support DEIA

DEIA is free and open source. If it saves you from losing context in crashes,
consider sponsoring development:

💖 [Sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/deiasolutions)

Your support funds:
- Conversation logging improvements
- BOK curation and quality control
- Documentation and tutorials
- Community support
```

---

## Category 2: Community Platforms

### Options Analysis

| Platform | Pros | Cons | Good For | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|----------|----------------|
| **GitHub Discussions** | Built-in, searchable, persistent | Less real-time | Q&A, feature requests, long-form | ✅ PRIMARY |
| **Discord** | Real-time, voice channels, free | Chaotic, not searchable | Support, quick help, community | ✅ SECONDARY |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional credibility, decision-makers | Not real-time, business focus | Thought leadership, partnerships, visibility | ✅ TERTIARY |
| **Reddit** | Good discovery, voting system | Toxic moderation, you dislike it | Optional, not primary | ❌ SKIP |
| **Slack** | Professional, organized | Expensive for large communities | Internal team only | ❌ SKIP |
| **Discourse** | Forum format, self-hosted | Requires maintenance | Alternative to Reddit | ⏸️ MAYBE LATER |

### Recommended Setup

**PRIMARY: GitHub Discussions**
- Enable on deiasolutions/deia repo
- Categories:
  - 💡 Ideas & Feature Requests
  - 🙋 Q&A (Help & Support)
  - 📢 Announcements
  - 🏗️ Constitution & Governance
  - 🔌 Vendor Integration Requests
  - 💬 General Discussion
  - 🐛 Bug Reports (or use Issues)

**SECONDARY: Discord**
- Create DEIA Solutions Discord server
- Channels structure (see Category 3 below)

**TERTIARY: LinkedIn**
- Create LinkedIn Page (Organization)
- Post thought leadership content
- Build professional credibility
- See Category 11 below for details

**SKIP: Reddit**
- Not required for launch
- Can add later if community requests
- Or just point to GitHub Discussions

---

## Category 3: Discord Server Structure

### Recommended Setup

**Server name:** DEIA - Development Intelligence

**Identity separation:**
- **Server owner:** "DEIA Solutions" (organization account)
- **Admin/Moderator:** "DAAAAVE-ATX" (your personal account)
- This gives you admin powers while showing organizational ownership

### Channel Structure

## Category 4: Feedback Collection & Automation

### Daily Digest System

**Goal:** Dave gets daily summary of Discord/GitHub activity without drowning in notifications

**Tools:**

1. **Discord Webhooks → Notion/Airtable**
   - Capture messages from #feedback channels
   - Auto-categorize by channel
   - Daily email digest

2. **GitHub Actions → Daily Summary**
   - Scrape GitHub Discussions daily
   - Generate markdown summary
   - Email to you or post to private channel

3. **Zapier/n8n Automation**
   - Discord → Google Sheets
   - GitHub → Google Sheets
   - Daily aggregation script
   - Email digest

**Recommended setup:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/daily-digest.yml
name: Daily Community Digest

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * *'  # Daily at noon UTC

jobs:
  digest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch GitHub Discussions
        # Get new discussions/comments

      - name: Fetch Discord Activity (via webhook)
        # Get Discord messages from feedback channels

      - name: Generate Summary
        # Create markdown summary

      - name: Post to Admin Channel
        # Post to private Discord channel

      - name: Email Dave
        # Optional: Send email
```

**What the digest includes:**
- New feature requests (count + top 3)
- Bug reports (count + critical ones)
- Vendor requests (new vendors suggested)
- Constitution discussions (active debates)
- Support questions (unanswered count)
- New contributors (welcomed automatically)

---

## Category 5: Community Backlog Management

### Structure

**GitHub Projects Board:**
```
DEIA Community Backlog
├── 📥 Intake (New suggestions from Discord/Discussions)
├── 🔍 Under Review (DEIA Admin reviewing)
├── 👍 Approved (Ready for implementation)
├── 🚧 In Progress (Someone working on it)
├── ✅ Done (Merged/Released)
└── 🚫 Declined (Won't implement, with reason)
```

**Automation:**
- Discord message in #feature-requests → Auto-creates GitHub Discussion
- GitHub Discussion upvoted (10+) → Auto-moves to "Under Review"
- Admin labels "approved" → Moves to "Approved" column
- PR merged → Moves to "Done"

**Dave's workflow:**
1. Check daily digest (1 email, 5 minutes)
2. Review "Under Review" column (prioritize)
3. Label approved items
4. Community sees transparency

---

## Category 6: Vendor Integration Process

### For End Users (Community)

**Request process:**
```
1. User posts in #vendor-requests (Discord) or GitHub Discussions
2. Template requires:
   - Vendor name
   - Why it's useful
   - API availability
   - Community interest (upvotes)
3. DEIA Admin reviews
4. If approved → Moves to backlog
5. Implementation → Added to bok/platforms/[vendor]/
```

**Vendor directory structure:**
```
bok/platforms/
├── railway/
├── vercel/
├── aws/
├── render/          (pending: community requested)
├── fly-io/          (pending: community requested)
└── _requests/       (Queue of vendor requests)
    ├── render.md    (Request details, votes, discussion)
    └── fly-io.md
```

### For Admins (You + Trusted)

**CFRL Process:**
```
1. Admin sees vendor need (or community requests)
2. Admin creates bok/platforms/[vendor]/
3. Admin commits directly to master (or branch)
4. Auto-deploy to GitHub
5. Review later if needed (rollback if issues)
```

**Permissions:**
- @DEIA Admin (you) - Full write access, no review required
- @Trusted Submitter - Can create PRs that auto-merge (with checks)
- @Maintainer - Can merge PRs after review
- @Contributor - Must create PR, requires review

---

## Category 9: Identity Management

### Two Identities Strategy

**DEIA Solutions (Organization)**
- GitHub: @deiasolutions
- Discord: DEIA Solutions (server owner)
- Email: contact@deiasolutions.org
- Purpose: Official announcements, releases, governance

**DAAAAVE-ATX (Your Personal)**
- GitHub: @daaaave-atx (or whatever you use)
- Discord: DAAAAVE-ATX (admin role)
- Email: dave@deiasolutions.org (or personal)
- Purpose: Community interaction, support, development

**Why separate:**
- Organization looks professional
- You can interact casually as Dave
- Clear when you're speaking officially vs personally
- Easier to add team members later (they join @deiasolutions)

**Example interaction:**
```
DEIA Solutions (Server Owner): "DEIA v1.1 released with pattern extraction!"

DAAAAVE-ATX (Admin): "Thanks everyone for the feedback! That bug you
                      reported is fixed in this release. Let me know if
                      you hit any issues."
```

## Category 11: LinkedIn Strategy

### Why LinkedIn for DEIA

**Your audience is there:**
- Developers, architects, technical leads
- Decision-makers who approve tools/processes (CTOs, VPs of Engineering)
- Academic researchers (HCI, AI ethics, human-computer interaction)
- Corporate sponsors and potential partners
- Grant organizations and foundations

**Professional credibility:**
- LinkedIn = professional legitimacy for open-source projects
- GitHub Sponsors applications often check LinkedIn for verification
- Academic partnerships look for professional organizational presence
- Media/conference organizers verify projects via LinkedIn
- Potential employers see your thought leadership

**Content opportunities:**
- Share BOK patterns as posts (thought leadership on AI collaboration)
- Announce milestones (foundation formation, 1000 patterns, partnerships)
- Case studies from community contributions
- "What we learned this week from the DEIA community" series
- Technical deep-dives (how the logging system works, etc.)

### LinkedIn Page Setup (Organization)

**Create LinkedIn Page:**
- **Name:** "DEIA - Development Evidence & Insights Automation"
- **Company type:** Non-profit (change to Foundation when 501(c)(3) formed)
- **Industry:** Software Development / Information Technology and Services
- **Company size:** 1-10 employees (initially)
- **Website:** Link to GitHub repo (for now), then deiasolutions.org
- **Tagline:** "Never lose context in AI-assisted development. Log conversations, share patterns, build knowledge together."

  - Description: Brief overview of what DEIA is and your vision
- **Skills:** Add relevant skills (AI collaboration, knowledge management, open source governance)
- **Featured:** Pin DEIA GitHub repo

**Two-voice posting strategy:**
- **DEIA Page posts:** Official, polished, professional announcements
- **Your personal posts:** Behind-the-scenes, personal journey, technical insights
- Cross-post where appropriate (your personal post → share on DEIA page)

**Example:**
```
DEIA Page Post:
"Announcing DEIA v1.0 - Open-source conversation logging for AI-assisted development.
Never lose context from crashes again. 🎯"

Your Personal Post:
"My computer crashed today and I lost 3 hours of work with Claude Code. So I built
DEIA to solve this - here's how the logging system works and why I used Ostrom's
governance principles..."
```

### Content Calendar (Weekly)

**Week 1 posts:**
- **Monday (Personal):** "Why I built DEIA: The $100/month tool that loses context"
  - Your frustration with crashes
  - The pain of losing conversations
  - How DEIA solves this

- **Wednesday (DEIA Page):** "Introducing DEIA v1.0"
  - Official announcement
  - Key features
  - Link to GitHub

- **Friday (Personal):** "3 lessons from building an open-source knowledge commons"
  - Technical insights
  - Governance challenges
  - Community early wins

**Week 2 posts:**
- **Monday (DEIA Page):** "Pattern Spotlight: Railway HTTPS Redirect Workaround"
  - Share a BOK entry
  - Explain the problem and solution
  - Invite contributions

- ✅ Explain technical concepts clearly
- ✅ Link to GitHub for technical details
- ✅ Use storytelling (your crash story, contributor stories)
- ✅ Engage with comments (build relationships)
- ✅ Tag relevant people/orgs (Anthropic, contributors, partners)

**What NOT to DO:**
- ❌ Spam connection requests
- ❌ Auto-post everything from GitHub (be selective)
- ❌ Make it sales-y (you're building commons, not selling SaaS)
- ❌ Ignore it (weekly minimum or don't start)
- ❌ Only post announcements (mix in thought leadership)
- ❌ Overuse hashtags (2-3 relevant ones max)

### Engagement Strategy

**Build connections with:**
- **AI/ML community:** Claude, Cursor, Copilot users
- **Open-source maintainers:** Learn from established projects
- **Knowledge management experts:** PKM community, researchers
- **Academic HCI researchers:** Potential partners for studies
- **Corporate DevRel:** Anthropic, Vercel, Railway developer relations
- **Grant organizations:** Mozilla, NSF, Open Source Initiative

**LinkedIn Groups to join:**
- Open Source Developers
- AI & Machine Learning
- Knowledge Management
- Human-Computer Interaction

**Comment on relevant posts:**
- Anthropic/Claude announcements (share DEIA use cases)
- AI coding assistant discussions (offer DEIA perspective)
- Open-source governance debates (cite Ostrom research)

### Metrics to Track

**LinkedIn Page analytics:**
- Follower growth (target: 100 in first month, 500 in 3 months)
- Post impressions and engagement rate
- Click-throughs to GitHub
- Company page views

**Personal profile:**
- Connection requests (quality over quantity)
- Post engagement (likes, comments, shares)
- Profile views
- Search appearances for "DEIA" or "AI development tools"

**Business impact:**
- GitHub stars/forks from LinkedIn traffic
- Community joins from LinkedIn
- Partnership inquiries via LinkedIn
- Speaking/podcast invitations

### LinkedIn + Other Platforms Integration

**Cross-platform strategy:**
- **GitHub Discussion → LinkedIn Post:** Turn good discussions into thought leadership
- **Discord conversation → LinkedIn insight:** Share anonymized learning
- **BOK pattern → LinkedIn article:** Deep-dive on pattern with context
- **Personal blog → LinkedIn:** Republish on LinkedIn Articles

**LinkedIn drives to:**
- GitHub (for code and contributions)
- Discord (for community chat)
- GitHub Discussions (for Q&A)

### Timeline

**Week 1 (Launch week):**
- [ ] Create DEIA LinkedIn Page
- [ ] Update personal LinkedIn with DEIA role
- [ ] First post: "Why I built DEIA" (personal)
- [ ] First post: "Introducing DEIA v1.0" (page)

**Week 2-4 (Establish presence):**
- [ ] Weekly posts (alternate personal/page)
- [ ] Join relevant LinkedIn groups
- [ ] Connect with 20-30 relevant people
- [ ] Comment on 5-10 relevant posts/week

**Month 2-3 (Build momentum):**
- [ ] Increase to 2-3 posts/week
- [ ] Feature community contributors
- [ ] First LinkedIn article (deep technical dive)
- [ ] Track analytics and adjust strategy

### Quick Win: First Post Draft

**Your first personal post (Day 1):**
```
My computer crashed today. I lost 3 hours of conversation with Claude Code—
all the context, decisions, and patterns we'd built together. Gone.

I'm paying $100/month for Claude Code. It's amazing for development, but
it doesn't save our conversations. When it crashes, you start from scratch.

So I spent the afternoon building DEIA (Development Evidence & Insights
Automation)—a system that logs every conversation locally. Now when Claude
crashes, I have a timestamped record of everything.

But it's more than a backup. DEIA helps you:
- Extract reusable patterns from AI sessions
- Share knowledge with your team (privacy-safe)
- Build a community Book of Knowledge

Governance inspired by Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize research on commons.
Privacy-first. Security by design. Open source.

Never lose context again.

- 1,000+ page followers
- Regular thought leadership posts
- Known in AI developer community
- Speaking opportunities via LinkedIn connections

**Year 2+:**
- DEIA Foundation announcement via LinkedIn
- Academic partnerships announced
- Corporate sponsors acknowledged
- Industry recognition (conferences, media)
