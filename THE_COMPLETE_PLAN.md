# The Complete DEIA Plan

**Status:** 2025-10-06 - Post-crash recovery, logging system built
**What works:** Conversation logging (tested)
**What's next:** GitHub push, FBB setup, docs

---

## What We Built Today (Post-Crash)

### Problem
Computer crashed. Lost entire Claude Code conversation. Hours of work gone. **Unacceptable.**

### Solution Built
**Conversation logging system** - Never lose context again.

**What it does:**
- Logs every conversation to `.deia/sessions/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-conversation.md`
- Auto-updates `project_resume.md` with summary
- Creates INDEX.md for quick lookup
- Works across all projects

**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING (tested with 4 logs)

---

## Three Workflows Explained

### Workflow 1: Dave Working in Other Projects (FBB, etc.)

**User experience:** Every conversation logged automatically. If crash, read latest log and resume in seconds.

**What you do:**

1. **One-time setup per project:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/familybondbot  # or any project
   mkdir -p .deia/sessions
   cp /path/to/deiasolutions/src/deia/logger.py .deia/logger.py
   echo ".deia/" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **At end of EVERY Claude Code session:**
   ```
   /log-conversation
   ```
   (We'll create this slash command next)

   Or manually:
   ```python
   from .deia.logger import quick_log
   quick_log('what we did', 'conversation text')
   ```

**Result:**
- Log created: `.deia/sessions/20251006-HHMMSS-conversation.md`
- Index updated: `.deia/sessions/INDEX.md`
- If crash next session: `cat .deia/sessions/INDEX.md` ‚Üí read latest log ‚Üí resume

**Why this works:**
- Local-first (never leaves your machine)
- Gitignored (private)
- Timestamped (chronological)
- Structured (context, decisions, files, next steps)

**Example FBB session:**
```
10:00 - Start work on auth feature
12:30 - Session ends, run /log-conversation
       ‚Üí Creates .deia/sessions/20251006-103000-auth-feature.md
       ‚Üí Captures: what we built, decisions made, files changed

Computer crashes at 14:00

14:05 - New Claude session opens
       "Claude, read .deia/sessions/INDEX.md, then read the latest log"
       ‚Üí Claude: "I see you were working on auth feature. Files: auth.py,
                  test_auth.py. Decision: Use JWT tokens. Next: Implement
                  refresh logic. Let's continue."
```

### Workflow 2: Dave Maintaining DEIA Itself

**User experience:** Work on DEIA features, log conversations, push updates to public GitHub repo.

**What you do:**

1. **Work in deiasolutions repo:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\davee\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\deiasolutions
   # This IS the DEIA repo
   ```

2. **Log conversations just like Workflow 1:**
   ```
   /log-conversation
   ```
   Your DEIA admin logs go to `deiasolutions/.deia/sessions/`

3. **Separate your private work from public:**
   - `.deia/` - Your private logs (gitignored)
   - `admin/` - Your private deliberations (gitignored)
   - `project_resume.md` - Your session context (gitignored)
   - Everything else - Public (will be on GitHub)

4. **Push updates to public:**
   ```bash
   git add bok/patterns/new-pattern.md  # Add new BOK entry
   git commit -m "Add pattern: New Pattern Name"
   git push origin master
   ```

**Result:**
- Your private DEIA work stays private
- Public improvements go to GitHub
- You wear two hats: end-user + admin

**Why this works:**
- `.gitignore` separates public/private
- You log conversations like any user
- You push code like a maintainer

---

### Workflow 3: Other Devs Using DEIA

**User experience:** Install DEIA, log conversations, optionally share patterns with community.

**What they do:**

1. **Install (future - for now manual):**
   ```bash
   pip install deia  # Coming soon
   # For now: Copy logger.py manually
   ```

2. **Initialize in their project:**
   ```bash
   cd /their/project
   deia init
   # Creates .deia/, copies logger, updates .gitignore
   ```

3. **Use it:**
   ```
   /log-conversation  # In Claude Code
   # Or: deia log conversation (CLI)
   ```

4. **Optional: Share patterns:**
   ```bash
   # Extract useful pattern from log
   deia extract .deia/sessions/20251006-*.md

   # Review and sanitize
   deia sanitize .deia/intake/pattern.md

   # Submit to community
   deia submit .deia/intake/pattern.md
   # Creates PR to github.com/deiasolutions/deia
   ```

**Result:**
- They never lose context (logging)
- They optionally contribute patterns (BOK)
- Privacy-first (nothing shared unless they choose)

**Why this works:**
- Simple: Just copy one file to start
- Opt-in: Sharing is optional
- Safe: Sanitization before submission

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What Works NOW

1. **Conversation logging**
   - `src/deia/logger.py` (350+ lines, tested)
   - Creates timestamped logs
   - Auto-updates project_resume.md
   - Maintains INDEX.md

2. **Documentation**
   - `docs/conversation-logging.md` (400+ lines)
   - `FOR_YOUR_OTHER_CLAUDE.md` (instructions for other projects)
   - `README.md` (public-ready)
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (contributor guide)

3. **CLI** (partial)
   - `deia log conversation` (works)
   - Other commands stubbed out

### üöß What's Built But Not Deployed

1. **Public GitHub repo**
   - All files ready
   - `.gitignore` configured
   - Just needs `git push`

2. **VS Code extension spec**
   - Full design document written
   - Not implemented yet

3. **Auto-submission**
   - Config schema designed
   - Not implemented yet

### ‚è∏Ô∏è What's Not Built Yet

1. **`deia init`** command
   - Spec written (`init_enhanced.py`)
   - Not integrated into CLI

2. **Pattern extraction**
   - Command stubbed
   - Logic not implemented

3. **Sanitization**
   - Guide written
   - Automated tool not built

4. **Trusted submitter (CFRL)**
   - Config schema exists
   - Workflow not implemented

---

## The Plan Forward

### Phase 1: Make It Usable (TODAY)

**Priority 1: Slash command**
```bash
# Create /log-conversation command
# So we can use it in every session
```

**Priority 2: Log THIS conversation**
```bash
/log-conversation
# Capture everything we did today
```

**Priority 3: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git push origin master
# Make DEIA public
```

**Result:** DEIA is public, we have slash command, today's work is logged.

---

### Phase 2: FBB Setup (NEXT SESSION)

**Set up FBB with DEIA:**
1. Find FBB directory
2. Create `.deia/` workspace
3. Copy logger.py
4. Create `.claude/START_HERE.md` with logging instructions
5. Test logging in FBB

**Result:** FBB has conversation logging. Never lose FBB context again.

---

### Phase 3: Implement Missing Features (SOON)

**In priority order:**

1. **`deia init` command**
   - One command to set up any project
   - Like `git init` but for DEIA

2. **Pattern extraction**
   - `deia extract <session-log>`
   - Creates pattern template in `.deia/intake/`

3. **Sanitization tool**
   - `deia sanitize <file>`
   - Detects PII, secrets, suggests fixes

4. **Submission workflow**
   - `deia submit <file>`
   - Creates PR to public DEIA

5. **Trusted submitter (CFRL)**
   - Config: `trusted_submitter: true`
   - Auto-accept submissions from DAAAAVE-ATX

6. **VS Code extension**
   - Implement spec
   - Publish to marketplace

## How Logging Works (Technical)

### File Structure

**In any project:**
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .deia/              (gitignored)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.py       (copied from DEIA)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/       (conversation logs)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ INDEX.md    (auto-generated index)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20251006-HHMMSS-conversation.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ intake/         (patterns ready for submission)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          (includes .deia/)
```

### Log Format

**Each log contains:**
```markdown
# DEIA Conversation Log

**Date:** 2025-10-06T14:30:00
**Session ID:** 20251006-143000-conversation
**Status:** Completed

## Context
What we worked on

## Full Transcript
Complete conversation

## Key Decisions Made
- Decision 1
- Decision 2

## Action Items
- Completed: X, Y
- Pending: Z

## Files Modified
- file1.py
- file2.md

## Next Steps
What to do next session
```

### Auto-Update to project_resume.md

**Every log automatically:**
1. Updates `project_resume.md` with summary
2. Shows latest 3 decisions, 5 files
3. Reverse chronological order
4. Links to full log

**Example entry:**
```markdown
### [2025-10-06 14:30] 20251006-143000-conversation
**Context:** Built auto-logging system

**Key decisions:**
- Use timestamped filenames
- Auto-update project_resume.md
- Gitignore .deia/ by default

**Files modified:**
- src/deia/logger.py
- docs/conversation-logging.md

**Full log:** `.deia/sessions/20251006-143000-conversation.md`
```

## Why This Architecture

### Design Principles

**1. Local-First**
- Logs never leave your machine
- No cloud dependency
- No vendor lock-in

**2. Opt-In Everything**
- Logging: You trigger it
- Sharing: You choose what
- Anonymization: You review before submit

**3. Git-Like UX**
- `deia init` = `git init`
- `.deia/` = `.git/`
- Familiar to developers

**4. Privacy by Default**
- `.deia/` gitignored automatically
- Nothing shared unless explicit action
- Sanitization before any submission

**5. Fail-Safe**
- If DEIA breaks, logger.py still works (standalone)
- If GitHub down, logs still save locally
- If network drops, everything works offline

## FAQs

### Q: Do I need DEIA installed to use the logger?

**A:** No. Just copy `logger.py` to your project. Self-contained.

### Q: Where do my logs go?

**A:** `.deia/sessions/` in your project. Gitignored. Never committed.

### Q: What if I forget to log?

**A:** Context is lost. That's why we're creating `/log-conversation` command - make it easy to remember.

### Q: Do logs sync across machines?

**A:** No. Local only. If you want sync, commit logs to a private repo (not recommended - use cloud backup instead).

### Q: How do I share a pattern?

**A:** Extract to `.deia/intake/`, sanitize, submit via `deia submit` (when implemented) or manual PR.

### Q: What's CFRL?

**A:** Commit First, Review Later. For trusted submitters (like you). Submissions auto-accepted, can rollback if needed.

### Q: Can I use this with Cursor? Copilot?

**A:** Yes. The logger works anywhere. Slash command is Claude Code-specific, but you can use CLI or Python API.

### Q: What about VS Code extension?

**A:** Spec written. Not implemented yet. Would make logging automatic for all VS Code users.

## Next Actions (In Order)

1. ‚úÖ Create `/log-conversation` slash command
2. ‚úÖ Use it to log THIS conversation
3. ‚úÖ Update project_resume.md with today's work
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Push deiasolutions to GitHub
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Set up FBB with .deia/ workspace
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è Test logging in FBB

## Summary

**What DEIA is:** Conversation logging + pattern sharing for AI-assisted development

**Core problem solved:** Claude Code doesn't save conversations. Crashes lose context. DEIA fixes that.

**How it works:**
- Workflow 1 (Other projects): Copy logger.py, log sessions, never lose context
- Workflow 2 (DEIA admin): Same as Workflow 1, plus push updates to public
- Workflow 3 (Community): Same as Workflow 1, plus optional pattern sharing

**Status:** Logging works. Documentation complete. Ready to deploy.

**Next:** Create slash command, log this conversation, push to GitHub.
