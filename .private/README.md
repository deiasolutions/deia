# .private/ - Repository-Level Private Space

**This directory is gitignored and will never be committed.**

## Purpose

Personal workspace for the DEIA repository maintainer (Dave). Contains:
- Documentation with PII
- Private notes about project strategy
- Experimental ideas not ready for public
- Personal project management docs

## Structure
